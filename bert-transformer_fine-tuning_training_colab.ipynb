so take your credit card, great pastries and chocolate but why does the service have to be soooo slow and disorganized sigh, great ice cream but are the staff handpicked for their incompetence and total lack of training the service is that bad it's almost embarrassing, great baked goods but please don't remind me 1530 minutes before you close that we are closing at 6 as it's not polite it's not etiquette it's not nice to pressure customers to hurry up thank you, it's really hokey and old but not in a good way in an ancient dirty way a good place to view a cross section of west vancouver ie grey hair it needs to be renovatedthe 'old world charm' is simply not there, the gelato is good not quite to the italian standard but hey you can't have everything thx decor is tragic and the coffee is only 'accrptable' not 'outstanding', always a staple vancouver pizzeria not pretentious but good honest nongourmet pizza and pasta nice atmosphere and good staff, very good food and a basic honest restaurant the beef ribs are the best option it's a bit of a hipster place with loud hard rick music on the loud side not atmosphere inducing service was quick and fairly efficient but not overly attentive, this place has great freshly made tempura and good quality sushi excellent down town location and efficient rather than 'friendly' staff good value too, you can drink franchise coffee and then you can drink arti's coffee the difference is massive visit him once you will never look back, this is a great place to find beautifully crafted chocolates and frenchstyled pastries the coffee is good quality too the only downside is the lack of seating and the rather hap hazard way of serving the customers, food is good and wellpriced interior decor is tragic and service a bit slow if you want a good no frills greek experience this is a reasonable choice, good snack and coffee but needs a damn good clean it's pretty clear that the staff are not happy, it's a good place but really no ambience and when you use canned bamboo shoots you know you're not going to get authentic cuisine they try hard herebut not hard enough, you can't go past their pizza slices and freshsqueezed cranberry juice gets very crowded during lunch hourbut for a good reason nice, the pizza slice es used to be great but now they have compromised on the quality of their ingredients and it's gone down quite a bit, very good baked goods especially the croissants however the service sucks big time staff have horrible attitude, the ice cream is of course very nice if a little bit expensive the service is not goodslow and miserable staff should not serving ice cream to a willing public be a happy occasion, their burgers fries and shakes are simply the best in townand very healthy the pictures below do all the talking, just go you won't be disappointedgreat pizza great service great wine and beer selection tiramisu to die for happy happy joy joy, i had lamb korma and coconut chicken curry with naan and roti breadsvery good quality food and a fir price service is a little slow 25 minute wait for food but otherwise a good indian choicenice proud owner too, it's a very quirky place and microscopicso expect a lineup the service and the deserts easily make up for the wait good prices plunger coffeegood times, this is a terrific cafe with great art shows good coffee and deserts and a lovely calm ambience tyler the owner is fabulous and really values community and creativity a must try, very cool and authentic whiskeycocktail bar it's off the beaten track but that's what makes it so great huge selection knowledgeable staff very good happy hour and decent charcuterie board definitely a must see when in portland area, it's a great location just fabuloushorrendous service  if you want to be ignored and treated with derision then this is the place for yousuch a damn shame, the happy hour choices are quite good atmosphere is fairly pedestrian and the service is very mediocre inattentive and uninterested staff, not that good honestly go to robson street location for better waffles and waaay better service, i went there for the first time about a month ago clean spa great spa pedicure prices are good and the toes came out amazing]</td>\n","      <td>[tonight the macaron du jour' was the lycheeabsolutely yummybut still the hands down favourite are the coffee andor chocolate caramel whichever i munch on first, friday's nite batch just soso the filling just oozed out of every bite just guessing wasn't chilled long enoughsigh worst ones everbut still sweet the lemon raspberry , overhyped in my opinon honestly nothing exceptional macaroons and chocolates are very standard i love their passionfruit mousse though a staple every time i visit, artistic and tasty desserts it's a pricey place and crowded with young kids so it can be noisy but the desserts are worth it  the macaroons are quite big so go nuts and enjoy  the americano was delicious, i love their macarons it's chewy and not too sweet my only complaint is that they always run out of of varieties, very happening place lots of people from all over the world we had to chose from so many desserts that looked amazing don't think you can go wrong, amazing  location  delicious thick hot chocolate and great treatswe always ho there for dessert  and we are  both impressed each time will revisit, great selection of desserts the passionfruit dome cake with mini macarons on around the bottom of the cake was delicious, the desserts here are amazing we even got a cake for a birthday and it was delicious staff are wonderful coffee could be better, kenneth n's recommendation of thierry's macarons persuaded me to returnsmooth crust chewy cookie light creamy filling reasonable sweetness that does not overpower the flavour yum i haven't had a disappointing flavour to date, fall in love with their tiramisu looks so adorable and the cream is perfect friday night is busy we sat on the patio to enjoy the late night sweet, love the desserts at this place   my favorites are the lemon tart millefeuille and chocolate marquise   busy place desserts are not cheap but worth it   love these french desserts and keep wanting to come back  staff are pretty nice and service is pretty fast, a friend treated us to a sleeve of fruitflavoured macaronsthey are so delectablebest way to eat it is so pop it whole in your mouththe berry  lemon are so goodi could eat a whole sleeve by myself, their pastries are the best in vancouver we went there on a saturday night but it was crowded as usualunfortunately choices were limited chocolate trio was awesome also the tea had a strong taste just like indian teas, sophisticated food really high quality and class but so crowded and noisy and often lacks free tables, beautiful cafe very attentive and knowledgable staff however their desserts are too sweet for me i've tried their macarons and their cakes and they're just way too sweet for me but their displays are very attractive, the macarons there are good but i think it's a bit too sweet and hard personally like soirette more the desserts are quite expensive but it's at great location to have a bakery though which is probably why, desserts and pastries are beautiful and almost is tasty try to find a quiet time otherwise you're competing with the self obsessed rude people coffee here is extra good and nice pick me up early in the day, visited last night  it's so busy on a friday night  food was great  service was fast  i love the liquid chocolate, everything i have had from thierry is to die for if you have a sweet tooth you absolutely need to try thierry, there is no place in vancouver like this omg everything is to die for i could eat their tiramisu cake everyday hahaaa since i moved back from toronto i was looking for something like this love u guys keep up the good work, since my last visit the quality bounced back up again it is simply one of the few good options you have in townthey now have two japanese baristas that makes coffee precisely and accurately it is fun to see them workpastry is good and cakes are fantastic, yes if you love french desserts this is the place to go i celebrated my birthday here and had a few of the delicacies and they were so good i'd recommend the layer cake and some of the classics it's a cute little cafe as well, the service was at best minimal coz they are under staffed also the price point is not justifiable for the quality of drinks and food better luck next time if they don't change will not come back, i had drinking chocolate and a pear danish which were superb and a croissant which was pretty good  10 for all three was neither great nor terrible but i felt it was reasonable given the high rent district, tried their coveted macaroons and an opera cake still not convinced that the place is worth returning to other than the fact that their bags are really pretty and would be really presentable as gifts, thierry is a treasure it's a wonderful place to visit with girlfriends and it's open until midnight the cakes there are amazing, i love this cafe it's one of my favorites in vancouver anything you order here will be amazing though i recommend the hot chocolate with or without liqueurs, really really good macaroons  everything else is decent too  just a nice upscale hangout place in downtown  definitely beats timmy's across the street, great upscale cafe with boozie options available  it's always packed but their outside seating is comfortable with the heaters going  their liquid chocolate is so yummy as well as their macaroons their cakes are really beautiful and they even have a gluten free cake, amazing chocolates and desserts but terrible cappuccino  unfortunately they don't know how to steam milk the way so it's nice and foamy and creamy  it's just boiling hot milk mixed with espresso  i wish they learn how to make it right, tried the forest cake and salted caramel latteboth are not my thing i didn't finish any of it, this is my late night downtown dessert place the service is always friendly and the dessert displays never fail to nudge my appetite  even after dinner i love the lively atmosphere and how i can chat and catch up with a girlfriend without feeling pressured to leave even once it gets busy, great patio season  just walked over for some macaroons and tea i love this place for a late night treat in the summer  it's only april but it's hot enough to sit out yay, best place ever if you have a sweet tooth i love pretty much everything from the deserts to the drinks great service and also for it being packed in the evenings the staff work fast and efficient, good fresh ingredients and pastriessweets found it to be a bit pricey so i won't be a regular customer but is popular in vancouver, awesome dessert and macarons  it's always busy during weekends which makes it hard to find a table to enjoy your dessert, great after dinner spot for dessert and coffee  this place is trendy and expensive but given the area i understandthe desserts cakes are just right  not too sweet or creamylooks like the serve alcohol too, cute little pastrychocolate shop in downtown vancouver on alberni street they have the best tiramisu and palmiers but i find that thomas haas has a better selection and quality it is great that they're open late and also serve alcohol, run by the same folks behind blue water cafe grabbed a decent pain au chocolat here before stanley park, tiramisu is my to go desert  love it and also pair with london fog tea  im in heaven lalalala, hands down favourite place to have desert and tea it is a known fine dining desert place so be ready to wait for seat deserts and tea are phenomenal definitely recommend to stop by if you are in the neighbourhood, 6 of us dropped in for a little treatit was my1st time and it was a pleasant surprise  excellence is all over this place in every way  you won't be disappointed at thierry, i love it when places stay consistent  after a year their desserts are still just as good  sure the price tag is sometimes a little high but in my opinion they are worth it, best macarons ever and the lattes are great nothing else i've tried has really stood out to me as being that amazing stick to the macarons they're outstanding my favourite flavours cassis lemoncherry  lychee, sandwiches should be warm coffee is too hot always bad baristas i burned my tongue many times other than that they are always open holidays weekends late nights lots of seats napoleon is delicious, not even the aggressive couple behind me in line who tried to edge me out with their stroller loaded with tiffany's bags could stop me from coming here again  just tried their macarons but holy crap were they delicious  plus their selection of wobbly coffees is amazing, i got the macarons here and they were pretty good but it would've been nice if there was more selection, i love the desserts and coffee at this place is really good place to sit and relaxlove the passion cake and london fog here, i don't usually eat anything related to chocolate but cannot say no to theirry's chocolate marquise they also have the best tiramisu in town, winner winner chocolate for dinner macaroons and the triple layer chocolate cake are 10s just try and you will know that chef thierry knows desserts i am happy that i got to try the treats oh and the hot chocolate was just right, their hot chocolate is good  their macaroons are too sweet  not a fan  overpriced food and drinks but once in a while is okay , expensive but tasty chocolate treats decent coffee in an area with few options outdoor seating is nice if you can get a seat often very busy pretty wood panel decori prefer 49th parallel one block away it has much better coffee and some of the best donuts in the city, knocking it down one star because of the lack of selection for macaron flavors i'm assuming that flavors tend to run out later in the day the only thing i wanted to get was the salted caramel and it would've been extremely disappointing if they didn't have that, a great place to enjoy a conversation over very good coffee and pastries interior is well done and comfortable they have a mixture of small tables and adirondack chairs outsidethe cinnamon rolls here are doughy and heavy on the icing]</td>\n","    </tr>\n","

some songs for years  very nice edition, if lois lane had died at the beginning of the move it would have made the movie better  if lois lane had been any other actress in the world it would have made a better movie  if superman would have dropped lois lane out of the sky to her death it would have made the movie great, a very enjoyable fantasy about divorces  as a retired court reporter nothing in this movie has anything to do with real divorce lawyers or family law litigation  but  it's very well done and very funny, very interesting piece of medical history where women would go to doctors for the doctors to masturbate them into climax as a cure for boredom and other female complaints  very well done with a good script, you know  there are some movies that just plain stink from the very first scene and this is one of those films  i couldn't get past the first few minutes  i had this creepy feeling in the back of my neck that i shouldn't be watching this film and i changed channels, it's hard to watch robin williams being funny after his suicide  i understand suicide is a personal decision and i don't have any opinion on his suicide but it's still very sad to watch him in a movie  he was one of my favorite comedians and we'll miss him, absolutely great  fantastic  wonderful  bought this used but it came in a heavy box resembling a grave with imitation grass on the top  very cute idea for the box  even though it was used the pictures are exceptionally clear, a very well done scifi film even though whoopi goldberg's role is totally silly and should never have been included  how the writers thought to put whoopi in a serious scifi film is hard to understand  the plot doesn't make sense if you analyze it but the film moves along regardless, wow  what a great action movie  the chase scene in the middle of the movie with trucks and things flying around is fantastic  the acting is great  the plot if great  this is a fun film for anyone  some adult stuff in it but no nudity, drag me to hell is a favorite horror film of mine  funny and witty but scary in a nongrossout kind of way  there is some gross stuff but the story and acting is topnotch]</td>\n","      <td>[what great acting and the way he comes back to school and learn wow and how some of the teachers are not so nice to him and some are and how he remembers this stuff who knows but i really liked this movie, a very funny and diverse kind of movie it is faced paced and touches a lot of subject matter throughout nicely casted and a really enjoyable watch, another funny movie with rodney dangerfield  sally kellerman is great in it too  if you want to laugh at rodney's antics as an adult student returning to school you'll love this, this is probably the single funniest movie of alltime and it isn't even ranked in all the opinion polls of top comedieswhich should tell you right there that it's great, school will never be the same especially when dangerfield steps in with his own brand of thinking why work when you can pay people to do it something i think we all have thought before, i just hope rodney finally gets the respect owed him i frankly think that this is his best work if you want to see a good screw ball comedy about university then here you go, rodney dangerfield's classic blue collar comedy is very funny although i prefer 'easy money' to this film it's still a must have i have the older edition which is ok but i was not all that happy with the newest edition to make the upgrade this film deserves better, greater than citizen cane the godfather or any other film ever made this to me is the essence toward which all hollywood film making must strive, rodney dangerfield at his funniest and he still gets no respect and an early performance by robert downey jr also an early performance form the late sam kinison as a psycho history teacher kind of reminds me of some the teachers i used to have if you ever thought about going back to college don't, this is one of my favorite movies i've seen it so many times and i still laugh out loud i bought this for the extras and it was worth it, a guilty pleasure  dangerfield's best movie will make you laugh out loud  if not you get no respect from me, escogi esta calificacion porque el producto es muy buenome gusta por su presentacion y calidadlo recomiendo a cualquier cliente interesado es una

looks like a school girl waiting for the bus with his hairdoagain lame o , new mexicos plethora of landscapes amazes me and makes this movie pop like it should  hats of to the producers  excellent well made film  any chance we'll see part 2 i've noticed almost all movies shot in nm are four or five star  pretty amazing statistically speaking  i want more, now that's what i call a horror flick or should i have said gorror flick  yes it was gorriffic and had all the elements of a good chop em up  movie worth the price of the ticket   i look forward to sequel, excellent from the get go and it never lets up  don't expect a dissapointing end either  the flick rocks plenty of gore and scenes of graphic  nature  exactly what you want from a kick ass horror movie, wow this movie put me to sleep and no matter how many times i hit rewind it was still boring  lackluster to say the least  i should have waited until it arrived on netflix, wow a serious fright night flicks for the over 18  just when you thought it was safe to adopt again  here come the orphan, i could never understand why anyone would find this funny  it fell flat for me like a can of soda left out overnight  no fizz pass, this is a great movie like kill bill  always keeps you on your toes  starts fast and ends fast  two thumbs up, one of the best sequels i've seen in a long time  i was not left bored for a minute  the frights and violence never lets up so be prepared, the adult version blows doors on the kiddie version  a must see movie for those who like action adventure and horror all wrapped in one burrito, great thrill ride i just hated the ending  very corny the movie delivers when it comes to scares but went from a crazy scary movie to this fantastical butterfly ending  really, one of my favorite franchise movie houses  lots of action gore and special effects not another low budget  i'm always shocked at the many  ways one can die and this movie has no problem introducing you to several more, splinter is one of those flicks that you just have to watch and you'll probably enjoy it's not too hard core horror and not tame eitheri had a good time watching the flick but remembered very little about it the next day  not memorable but not that bad either  give it whirl, a movie with monsters brutally created using scrap metal and humansparts to annihilate you  gorehounds will salivate like a rabid dog for this movie, maddening to the point that you cannot help but applause max  gritty and teeth grinding  a classic cult fav and worth the watchwatch it now i insist, this movie rocked and this superman by far is the best looking superman ever i can see there are a few one star ratings from men  probably due to the fact that many wives screamed out his name later that night, this movie is not even close to being as good as the first  this will soon be free on amazon prime and on netflix  i'm not the only one saying it like it islame duck of a movie if there ever was  i will say no more, really good movie that actually see plausible i was gripped from the beginning and unlike most flicks these day had frozen to my tv screen, one of the best movie's i've seen all year  critics hated this movie because it was shot in beautiful nm and not in ny city lol  i love movies made in nmthe state is so beautiful unlike any other place on the planetkeep them coming, always a non stop hang on to your lollipop thrill ride with this series  never fails to deliver every time  one of the best movie franchises in my opinion and i've seen a lot of movies  highly recommended for scifi freaks action and adventure nuts and horror hounds alike, gnashing teeth all over the place and there's enough gore to go around for everyone without the movie losing it's scary effect  piranha 3 will leave a hole in your head but not in your wallet  well worth the ticket  i can hardly wait for number 4  i just can't get enough of piranhas, i so dig a horror flick that has all the chrome and glass it takes to make a solid horror bonanza  five stars big time, an old man trying to keep up with the kardashians and falls short way short  the reviewers giving this flick high marks are the same senior citizens that voted for our so called pres  no thank you, a great movie reminds me of friday the 13th without the mask only this flicks much more gruesome and unforgiving  a definite for those who like violence and gore, great thrill ride i just hated the ending  very corny the movie delivers when it comes to scares but went from a crazy scary movie to this fantastical butterfly ending  really, perhaps i was expecting too much in terms of this movie delivering a good scare  what i got  halfway through this movie i turned the tv off and never saw the ending part one was not any better, boycott movies with matt in them  he's a racist old man  bald and talentless not to mention shorter than a poodle on stilts, nothing new here folks  what i thought would be an all out blood bath on the streets of our cities like albuquerque nm  the movie turns out to be something totally different and i was not impressed  two thumbs down for this ridiculous movie, i was really hoping this would be a good movie but it was meant for television because all the gore and creepiness was for third graders not adults, a really interesting show with some great action shots and a new method for killing gunfu started slow but once it got going it never slowed down good cast]</td>\n","      <td>[its really funny if i may say i thought it was a pretty weirdgood horror movie i enjoyed it i was ridiculous but it is one you should see, wow  this was easily one of the stupidest films ever made  what the heck was up with the bitting kid  awful acting worse plot just a complete waste  i won't even bother with a summary i will just tell you avoid this like the plauge, my newest dvd player allows me to watch a movie at the 15 speed and still hear the dialogue with a movie like this that is a musthave extra it saved me from wasting more time on this piece of toxic medical waste, this flick was one of the best flicks done in a long time it has lots of raw meat  blood  exciting and it is a flick definitley worth owning  if you like gross then this is a movie for you  i love it, great new horror flicks dealing with infection 28 days later being the greatest followed close by eli roth's cabin fever great effects music acting edge of your seat and good laugh's at some points  great film, eli roth's cabin fever is one of the best horror movies i've ever seen its also one of the most original takes on the backwoods horror genre i loved it  i also think that director eli roth is a breath of fresh air to the horror world, attentiongrabbing offthewall good horror with some humor redneck inbreeding evident in the local town another steve miner good effort if u like his work try friday the 13th only parts 13 any good and also house starring  william katt, this movie was alright wasn't that good and wasn't that bad but not one of these movies u want to buy but a rental is good and i like the gross scenes but its still a pretty decent movie, this is the third time i have seen  this movie it is a fun movie and it has its scary parts rider strong is still very likable the cast gives convincing performances and the pig lady is disgusting watch this one when you are feeling vulnerable or not it is better than cabin in the sky, a fun and gory classic hopefully eli roth will revert back to balls to the wall horror with his new film the green inferno, it is the water that make you go crazy  i did enjoyed this movie i do recomended it to everyone that likes gore  blood and cheesy stuff, goodscaryand funnymy whole family lauged at almost every seeni knew it would be

good the movie was ok kinda funny my 5 year old niece had no interest so i guess now we don't need to buy it , ehhhhh i was ok the older muppets were so much cuter back in the old days i rented it for a family night as my niece is 6 but she had no interest in it at all maybe cuter for the older kids but not so much young, long and boring is really all we can say yes she might of got good reviews for her acting but the movie sucked sorry guys , kind of reminded me of the blair witch project it was a good movie and the ending was surprising i wouldn't buy it but definitely worth renting, it was a cute movie to watch with my mommie definitely worth watching and amazon makes it easy to watch on my roku, between the great songs and animation you can forgive the mistakes or exaggerations they made with the original biblical story to tell a classic tale]</td>\n","      <td>[i wasn't really impressed with this movie mark  dwayne wasn't at their best i think that they are reaching to much, despite a decent cast i'm a big mark wahlberg fan and this being a true crime story the film was absolutely horrible  laughable script and things go downhill from theredo yourself a favor and give this one a miss, this movie was advertised as a comedy  it was instead a vicious mess of violence homophobia and whatever else they could throw in there  we were almost 34 of the way through it and we just finally said i just don't care anymore and shut it off, i really hate this because i think the rock is the best and mark walberg has done some good stuff as well but this on how can i say it nice i cant it sucks, this movie is fantastici recieved this movie earlier than the date on the computer the rockdwayne johnson  i think is a very good actor and also mark wahlberg too i feel you should purchase this movie  its worth it, i didn't even get halyway through the movie brfore i turned it off  i expected more from these two actors  a waste of money to purchase or to even watch  this of course is just my opinion but i am soory that i bought it, not a shabby movie didn't have any true expectations for this movie definitely not a sleeper but not one that i feel i need to see again, i expected more from a movie especially one that has mark wahlberg who i just love his films  just wasn't the wow factor i had hoped it would be but good entertainment  just a movie you could watch just once, i wish i had rented this first i wasn't exactly thrilled with the cheesiness of this movie unfortunately we watched it anyhow and now i can attempt to sell it to hastings or someone else on amazon if they'd b so willing that is always  mrs leanne m pruitt, oh my god i like the rock and stuff he's in and mark wahlberg is usually in some good stuff but this movie really sucks i mean it sucks bad  i would say rent it first before you buy it cause i'm not joking its bad, this had a chance with the tongue in cheek humor that pokes fun at muscular people but it was just a huge screw up that wasn't enjoyable for me the only positive is that this was a true story they were attempting to retell, absolutely don't watch it these  guys must have needed the money really bad even though it was based on true events it was the dumbest movie that i ever watched, if you're into films like spring breakers this movie is for you although it is somewhat based on a true story it does make the bad guys look like idiots the colors and choreography in this film is also really flashy and poppy, weak plot weak acting weak story and all of the filth makes this film a complete waste of money i preordered the blu ray and literally threw it in the garbage  what prompted these great actors to do this weak film  very sad, a must see film laughable action packed and dark humor not to mention based on a true story mark wahlberg and the rock deliver, interesting because of the history of the storyactors seemed to enjoy their roles since it was based on a true  story the gore must go onbut was handled well i thoughtalways enjoy wahlberg and johnson and they did a fine job together in this one, this is the worst piece of crap that i have ever seen it is not funny not exciting and not at all watchable cartoon characters with an annoying voice over i suffered through an hour but could not bear to watch it any longer, this film really surprised me funny loved the humor solid acting dark and graphic violence one of the best crime films of the year recommended, this review is on the blu ray disc of the moviemovie  45  5video  45  5audio  45  5very entertaining from start to finishsuper video and audio throughoutgood addition to your collection, i was not expecting this movie to have depth of character but it went well beyond my expectations of course it has some of the best and funniest actors in the business and the story was true which is what made it good, but this movie was definitely not his finest hour actually it was no ones i know i shouldn't expect oscar material from a farce butargh, i rented this movie and the script was not up to the actores on this movie it was a cmovie with a actors and i thought it was a lame excuse of a movie, i was very dissapointed in this movie had high hopes for it and it let me down big time was asshamed to say mark wahlberg was in it, this movie arrived on time as promise and in very good condition i would recommend this movie to anyone that likes the rock this is a very good movie to sit down on sunday afternoon and just watch the whole movie, very different kind of movie i liked it i think lol its definitely sad that this actually happened like some mark wahlberg, we recently watched this movie and found it close enough to the reallife scenario  which made it even more enjoyable  some of the scenarios were overthetop but good entertainment  we would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun movie  keep in mind however that in the reallife scenario people died, johnson's worst movie yet if you are into movies that are all about drug use and sexual themes you might like it not on the top 50000 movies that i have seen, duane johnson mark wahlberg omg  as far as i'm concerned they can just walk around onscreen and smile occasionally into the camera and i'll think there's a story there, this was okay it started out funny but man did it drag on and on finally the end i gave it 3 stars due to the actors that played in this one it was based on a true storywow, the producers of this movie were wrong if they thought viewers would enjoy this mindless mess thrown together even its big named stars couldn't save it we didn't finish the movie only half  don't waste your time watching it, boring and fairly dull  found myself fast forwarding the movie thru different parts as the dialogue especially and the 'action' in particularly was dull, i liked the movie and the characters i gave this 5 stars you should add this to your collection it is a must see, this bizarre heinous tale from the pit of depravity was hard to watch  who knows where this left true events and added junk hopefully that was carefully considered first but it's a story repeated plenty more than we know in this day and age of greed and meaningless pleasure, movie goers  get this and watch it on a lazy night lazy saturday with popcorn you will enjoy it  get surround sound you will need it, wow this movie just sucked so bad all the time  i get what they were trying to do we just did not like it  it might have been great acting if we liked the subject  sorry guys, the actors do a great job but the script didn't support them i loved seeing them together the rock is simplythe fact that the story is true is crazy  worth a watchrental, i love both of the actors in this movie  i was a little distracted at with the story line but once i caught on to the plot i enjoyed the movie  both stars were great, mark wahlberg is fantastic when he takes on the roll of the dumb guy this movie was all over the place but i really really enjoyed it, this is one movie that has the wrong actors and was hard to believe even though it was from a real story  these actors did not make the movie work at all, if it wasn't the fact that this was based on the true story i would have stop watching the movie  its ok but it is unbelievable on how things went, this film was based on a true story where really bad and violent things happened to real people and they made it a comedy  it wasn't funny in fact it was disturbing to watch knowing what was happening on film for the most part really happened  this film was no good, this movie is funny but it feels like it runs a little long  i think if the plot was a little more streamlined this movie could have been great, this movie freakin rocks man it is action packed and very funny if you haven't seen run out and buy it everyone should have this movie for your collection, not an oscar winner but definitely entertaining i think the director could have improved the movie by not dumbing down the characters so much, sorry that this was a true story but look at the cast in this bad boy who woudln't like it i loved it  every single moment of it, i expected a comedy with a lot of action i mean c'mon look at the actors even dwayne johnson is there but the movie was really just bad it's not funny and appears to be based on real events i just don't know what to like about it, the buildup for this movie far exceeded it's own ability to entertain  pretty stupid movie  however it was one of those that i was convinced i needed to see so now i have, surprisingly good good story hilarious at times had 35 out of 5 expectation before viewing but rate it a solid 5 for entertainment  story seems inconceivable until you real the true story its based on and how a version of these events really happened, i think the actors did a great job of playing these characters it's amazing how criminals are so dumb but when drugs and money is involved they are dumber, remember this is a true story you have to keep reminding yourself that the dramatized story is basically true these idiots actually did this, good movie i like it was a try storynice comedyaction storygood actors lot's of action mark wahlberg is always good and fun to watch, if you love movies like the hangover series you will probably love this as well  if not you may ffind you have wasted your time, don't like it full of bad jokes couldn't get into it i like mark wahlberg but this was very disappointing, bought because tony shaloub was in it what an awful movie i don't think we watched 20 minutes of it donated it to the library, you have to remind yourself that this really did happeni watched the youtube interviews with the cast and they said the weirder this movie got the closer to the truth it becameyou will not believe how weird it will getgreat cast great director great movie, excellenthard to believe it's a true storyi love anything that mark wahlburg is in  the rock is awesome as usuali saw this in the theater when it first came out loved it then  still is interesting a 2nd timei would recommend it, michael bay made a film about some of the dumbest criminals ever to walk miami's streets  it really was funny in some parts  it would have made an entertaining 45 minutes of law and order or csi miami  the idiocy just isn't enough to sustain interest for 130 minutes  i don't recommend wasting your time, i like my recent purchase of pain and gain from amazon instant video for my kindle fire hd it's a movie based on the real life kidnapping which took place in florida in the mid 1990's it's entertaining with a lot of strange twists and turns, not sure if it was supposed to be a dark comedy or a crime drama  it clearly tries to make light of what turns out to be a gruesome crime and it fails on both counts, amazingly bad for having some big name actors director and budget the rock who i like is terrible here all the actors except ed harris are terrible supposedly the story is true but it has to be embellished it is ridiculous in the extreme, i was a bit disappointed in this movie not what i thought it would be with the cast that starred in it very disappointed in this movie, pain  gain gotta love this true story crazy how all this happen to them had to buy this movie to add to my blu ray collection, a little slow to start and varies greatly from true accounts this is an extremely funny adaption of a horrible true story  a little sick but very entertaining, i did not finish this awful movie and gave it about 20 minutes then stopped  i do like mark and dwayne but not in this onethis just seemed so unreal  please do better next time, movie was good love any movie with dwayne in it didn't like the story line  but of course with dwayne in it well worth watching thank you so much, a different kind of movie that will only be appreciated when you watch it in its entirety it has action and it has a lot of humor lets just say it is about people becoming criminals but the shoes didn't fit, another great action movie with two more great actors the action movies keep me going all i know is when i decide on any more movies of any kind i will be back ordering from amazon again keep up the good work thank you, this was just an ok movie with mark whalburg maybe that's because it was based on a true story where people were really killed, good acting and good movie for those who like this kind of action movie  truth is i watch it only because the rock  dwayne johnson was in it, good cast but lame story line  the movie makes fun of men jews christianity and law enforcement  nothing new here, the rock has done lots of movies since his wwf days and i love him in just about all of his movies but this is his best performance yet  great also as always were mark wahlberg and anthony mackie and tony shalhoub, horrible film this shouldn't have been made essentially this film glorifies a few idiots that committed a very real and horrible crime look it up, i found the quality of this film excellent  the audio it down loaded without any problems the show it self was very amsuing, maybe it's just me but i did not like this movie in fact i hated it and gave it to my daughter who gave it to her daughter  they're making a part ii so obviously someone liked it but i did not]</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>4.90503</td>\n","

out can't wait for the next one war]</td>\n","      <td>[this was so funny  but even better than that was the story behind the movie  the acting was good and the jokes were hillarious  whomever did the makeup on johnny did a wonderful job  no wonder they were nominated for an academy award, it has funny parts but all in all its not a very good movie  i thought it would have stupid parts which would actually make it somewhat funny but its a stupid jackass of a movie, this whole thing looked set up all the best parts were in the commercial i love the idea but it wasn't executed properly, if you liked jackass then you will like this i recommend the un cut version more fun  closed captioning was out of sync though, this is supposed to be a movie  it tells a story however there is no plot and not very funny  got through twenty minutes and had to turn it off cause it was so boring, johnny knoxville is so funny in this show he is so crazybad grandpa is funny but has a serious ending a grandpa's love for his grandsonwatch it, i thought it was okay my husband thought it was greatsurpriseit's a man thing  it is worth watching though  some laughs, i did not finish this movie as i thought it was terrible to have the bad language and behavior that the main character put out there  so rude, this was pure low brow humor as usual johnny knoxville delivers his prank base humor very well  but it was not as funny as i was hoping there were some moments that left me a bit bored  even with the attempt at being a little heartwarming still it was worth a watch, really did not like bad grandpa  looked like they sat down and decided all the awful things that they could throw in one movie about the relationship of a kid and his grandpa  really thought it was in bad taste, ok so it is johnny knoxville what can you expect but i do think he did play the role quite well  my partner and myself are both 65 and we found a lot of humor in this movie  my hubby laughed so hard at some of the stuff that it made it well worth watching it, it is a very funny movie made with real people not actors  keep watching after the credits too funny gotta watch it in the end the grandpa makes the right decision, typical knoxville shenanigans  an entertaining movie better than the rest of the poorer quality films out there right  now  kinda sad that gag scenes are the best, the language wasn't as bad as i expected it to be  not for young people to watch  my husband and his guy friends thought this was the funniest movie they had seen in years, i should have known anything by jackass would have been something for a jackass to watch  i got so bored that i turned it off 14 o the way through  the makeup on grandpa who is a much younger man was so obvious it was stupid  stupid stupid movie, from the previews i thought this might be funny so i wached it  i found very little of it funny in the slightest and found most of it exteremely insulting and offensive, lame slow and boring but you can get a few good laughs out of it not that that will save this movie from being the wreck that it is, save the time and effort and watch the commercial over and over since the only funny parts in the movie were in the commercial, this is so funny i feel off the couch laughing my sides hurt so bad then something funny would happen again and i would lose it, i was expecting a really raunchy and offensive movie and instead found it to be one of the funniest i've seen  it certainly doesn't make fun of us old folks  i watched it with four others over age 62 and we all enjoyed it  highly recommended, what a funny movie it was a blast  the movie was better than i thought it would be if you put two great actors and real life people together well then u get great, i really like this movie it was very funny to me i especially loved the people's reactions to his outrageous behavior i would suggest to anyone that they order this movie if they like that jackass kind of humor , it wasn't bad but that's just itit wasn't good eithercant tell you what missing necessarily but you can tell its missingfell asleep 30mins in, bad grandpa is a comedy that is funnier than the smell of a puerto rican's poop this movie also has balls literally, i didn't realize until the end of the movie that most of the 'bystanders' were real people not actorsnot for children, one of the funniest movies of the year all the people that give it under 3 stars are 65 and over and just don't get it, you already know anytime you watch something with johnny knoxville you'll be laughing all the way through if you event seen it you're definitely missing out great adult humor, a great way to laugh in union of the family some liked it others simply saw a number of short clips from jackass put together to create a movie very realistic in terms of the jokes they have chosen, this movie was a gem  dirty disgusting and really funny  would i recommend it to a friend though  that depends which friend with this type of humor, we enjoyed this movie so much soooo funny and we defiantly think it's worth watching we've watched it a few times and we still think it's funny, i feel like i shouldn't like this movie but i found myself laughing at it it's a typical johnny knoxville prankster type movie don't expect anything deep from this movie it's light and funny and yes crude, the is movie is hilarious anyone who rates it with 1 or 2 stars completely lacks a sense of humor move past their review please johnny knoxville does a great job playing an elderly man, i enjoyed the movie  lots of gags  not the best movie i ever saw but far from the worst  i intend to keep the dvd as i intend to see it again and again, this dude cracks me up  man oh man oh man  johnny knoxville just keeps coming at you with more jokes and laughter than a little bit in this one  i love how ridiculously crazy he and his friends are willing to get  the antics are bold and amazing  shear entertainment in this one that did not disappoint, the storyline appeared to be forced just to say that there was a story to it instead of just having a creepy grandpa going around talking to random people but there were several funny scenes that had me laughing, it made me laugh but know this is a crude movie with some endearing qualities it is typical of jackass shows raunchy at times vulgar occasionally and many times tasteless but funny, cheeszy stupid and very inappropriate for an old grandpa to be so nasty and stupid  there were some scenes that made me laugh so hard it hurt  i watched it twice  value village scene was too good for just one viewing, i'm no prude but the high school boys bathroom humor wore thin in about the time it would take me to have a pee and get the hell outta there, i have never laughed so hard  i worked at comedy clubs for a number of years so it takes something really twisted to make me laugh  this movie did it, this is the best knoxville j film yet  it's outrageously funny with great slapstick right to the end and makes me enjoy the parody all the more  being an olde guy myself this film brings out the bad boy some of us have inside despite our age and makes me wanna act up more in public, don't watch this movie unless you plan on bursts of laughter at crude and rude stuff it's not suitable for young children or prudish people he's the kind of grandpa i sort of expect i will be one day unbelievably funny, i laughed i cried i think i shat myself hilarious movie johnny knoxville approaches borat territory with this epic story  performance get it, vulgar want to teach your kids how to been a terrible unkind bothersome sorry human watch this and then throw up, they performed in front of people and the unsuspecting people thought it was real they captured people's true reactions and that was ingenious  there were lots of rated r parts that took away from a the essenes of the film that is why i gave it a 3, the scene in the strip club is off the charts funny you'll replay it several times to see if your eyes are working properly, didn't finish watching it  some parts made me laugh or cringe  turned it off about a third the way through just didn't care for story line or acting, take this movie for what it was meant to be  don't go in with expectations of seeing a theatrical masterpiece i got more than 5 bucks worth of laughs i'm a satisfied customer, my son actually rented this so i watched it after him  i have to say there some very funny things int his movie  the ending is awsome, i thought this was supposed to be funny after sitting through 30 minutes it was far too stupid  slow to continue in my opinion a total waste total flop, these guys are full of it you have got to watch and don't forget the ending credits some more juicey details laugh laugh laugh you won't be disappointed, then this is the movie for you lol  i wouldn't watch again but i wasn't disappointed at the outrageous things they got away with and they were funny and just below the line where i was forever offended ha ha, wow this was hilarious  i laughed so hardso much better than those dumb movies  this movie is lots of funyou will laugh, this movie definitely did not live up to the hype  although i laughed a couple times i considered this movie to be more of a waste of time than something to do for entertainment, not for everyone pretty funny and if you enjoyed borat and like the jackass films  you will likely have fun with this similarly entertaining nightmare, i thought this would be a funny movie after watching the trailer i laughed and thought about kindergarten cop definitely not the case it's not even a movie it seems like skits from candid camera not worth the battery juice to turn on my ipad, awesome funny movie for adults johnny knoxville is one of the best actor he sure can act and talk like an old man, most people would probably give this movie a low rating it's filled with sophomoric humor and tasteless scenes on the other hand i have a sick sense of humor and this movie made me laugh, this is the second one that i had to buy cause some one borrowed my movie and didnot bring it back so thank you, an intense raw erotic yet compassionate love story splendid performances by the lead actresses realistic emotions so beautifully displayed highly highly recommended]</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","

can't believe it took me all these years to find it i watched both seasons twice, i absolutely love this show i've only seen seasons 1 and 2 i've heard that season 3 is not as good but will have to wait till it's available to decide for myself, i tried watching this but couldn't the main character's anger and ignoring his baby was too much he was such an unlikable person, i could barely get half way through this first episode di joseph chandler is the most boring annoying character i've seen in a long time, i wanted to like this move because it was a period piece however i couldn't get past the slow pace and predictable liberal platform after watching about 13 of it i gave up not my cup of tea, i have loved all of the inspector lewis episodes it's worth watching for the oxford setting but the actors are great too, i really enjoyed season one this is much better than the morse series because endeavour is not bitter and mean the way the older morse is, i loved this movie because of seth rogen andy is an incredible funny character though the barbara streisand character was annoying at times overall the movie was very funny, i have all the seasons and enjoy watching this show it

watching if you enjoy programs about the great outdoors, a history and cultural overview of those who live with the land how they survive comfortably in winter and summer and on rivers, shows the harsh conditions of life in a harsh climate  follows the trappers well but leaves their families out of it for the most part  it was very enjoyable, this is a true life adventure story with great photography scenery and the people are so natural  i had no idea there were people living in russia who live almost completely off the land with their families  i plan to watch this again  takes me to another place, i only watched a few minutes  the video is in a different language with captioning in english  what i saw going on in the film didn't make the trouble of reading captions worthwhile  the captions weren't always easy to read since they got mixed in with the background, way more interesting than i expected  it shows how people in a severe environment can survive  i was amazed at watching the building of a dugout canoe and wood skis  seeing in detail the techniques used in trapping and fishing was really great, i thought this was a great documentary unlike mounntain men this is really the way people live all their lives most interesting and quite enjoyable i do recommend it to all, this film ought to be mandatory for each school twice once in the 5th grade and then again in the 10th mandatory when the going gets rough i want them to have this story in the back of their minds , this was educational in that it showed how people were more self reliable in the past  it is a good movie to watch on a slow night  not great but a good documentary  it makes you really appreciated modern technology, interesting and refreshing take on life in siberia  definitely a backwoods kind of film  if you like hunting roughing it and jeremiah johnson you will like this film, good story spending a year in a wilderness deep in the heart os siberia the tales of surviaval mixed in with adventure this movie makes for good viewing, it is interesting but it let you wanting for more i think it could go deeper in the relations among the people having that life and lacks of a more intimate perspective but the landscaping and views are great if u like the cold, would liked to have seen more footage on life among the rest of village ie what would a normal dayweek be like and how the trappers washed themselves and their clothes how long did they sleep during the long summer days and short winter days how was dating and marriage established in the small villageetc, despite the misleading title not an unusually happy bunch an interesting documentary which is narrowly focused on the men of a remote russian village the happiness is really not explored but the trapper lifestyle is no time is spent on the families of the men or the overall culture still this was interesting, this is an engaging if simple portrait of men living in extreme conditions away from modern societyand loving it  i was transfixed, this is one of the very finest films i've watched in a very long time  it follows the life of a trapper in the tiaga  and what a life  such freedom to live on his own terms with the wilderness  such a life would not suit most people but it is so wonderful to see, amazing footage of the struggles the members of this small hamlet in the siberian wilderness to eke out a living based on millenia olde skills and wisdom garnered on the fierce wind swept artic tundra  when all others die these people will persist in their small outpost, after seeing how these people live in this harsh to us environment and attempt to make their living it makes you appreciate all that we enjoy and take for granted even more  i thought this was a very enjoyable program, interesting perspective of people living in an area of russia i never even knew about how they survive live their livesreal eye opener, an excellent picture for those who like to see the north country with its snow and solitude and for those who have a wanderlust to go out alone and survive in the wildernessthis is a pleasant story about a most dangerous life style, if you are having a sleepyquiet day and want to learn a little bit about a foreign place with snow on the ground the majority of the year true survivalists and hunters and mobs of horrible mosquitos then this is the documentary for you,

star trek film this should be it, average on all accounts  the war of the gargantuas had potential but lost it halfway though the movie  rodan was just a run of the mill film, the movie is entertaining and has good special effects but the characters are too one dimensional  if there was more character development then this would be a much better film, such a great installment of what spider man should be not like the bad toby mcguiresam rami version  this one really captures the essence of spidermanpeter parker from the comic books, much better than the 1997 one and almost as great as godzilla 1985  the visual effects look real the story is great i just wish that the bad creatures were scarier and that they returned to the 1985 godzilla face and eyes look, great miniseries about ww2  it takes you through some of the epic battles between the americans and the nazis and has characters that are multidimentional  way better than the pacific which is the followup miniseries, a classic tale of a vampire who was made and his life story all the characters are memorable and the acting and plot are done very well, your best your best losers are always claiming to do their best while the winners go home and fck the prom queen, this has the same feel as the three spaghetti's that eastwood did methodically paced to get you to feel every snap of bone tear of flesh and bloody bullet searing through a dying human i love it this is the way westerns are done the entire cast puts on a performances, the preview shows all the parts of the film worth watching a run of the mill actioner that uses big name stars instead of substance, it's really amazing how realistic this film was for its time  watching it now is still wonderful  disney knows how to make classic films, great miniseries about ww2  it takes you through some of the epic battles between the americans and the nazis and has characters that are multidimentional  way better than the pacific which is the followup miniseries, i liked soylent green 2001 and the time machine they were all enjoyable to watch  forbidden planet was a let down it started out strong and then lost it towards the end  overall 34 films that were great makes up for the one disappointment, a fun series that takes you into the life of a group of muslim terrorists and a muslim fbi agent that's out to stop them  it is written and acted superbly so much so in fact that you the viewer feel for and against the characters, way way better than the first one  this is what is great about action films  nice surprise cameos and solid action story with exceptional explosions acting and violence, so so so bad  so bad so bad  so bad not enough extracts in the world to sit through this  so bad]</td>\n","      <td>[i don't really like star wars that much it has tons of action wich is cool but they are kind of weird and i don't like the charecters that much the 1st movie is 4 stars out of 5 the secon and 3rd were probally both 2 or 3 stars, in my opinion the return of the jedi where darth vader fights luke skywalker is the best one but all 3 of them are pretty neat, with all this money he is getting when is george lucas going to have that goiter removed from around his neckthe first film or i guess number 4 is ok and the empire strikes back is wonderful but then the films all became kiddified  stupid the prequels are absolutely dreadful  ewoks must die, fantastic butits so heavily altered its is nothing near the original version i saw in 76 thats the only down side the repettitive changes that are not needed other wise great, collector must have it  a complete package of this and the other one for i to iiiyou will be happy if you buy the complete 2 packages of star wars in blue ray  you will not regret, i still wish you could get these films restored as seen in 1977 and so  i don't mind the remakes so much but i miss the originals and my vhs tapes are wearing out, need i say more the name speaks for itself nonstop action and excitement a must see for any scifi fan episode iv is my favorite, for those who don't have the special edition you're missing a great treat the added scenes and improved special effects makes these movies well worth watching carrie fisher priness leia in the bikini is hot, we've been waiting for this for years who cares about the alterations i got news for you every movie is altered slightly when it is released on video and the changes make the movies more enjoyable and help unify both trilogies i only hope that they make episodes vii viii and ix, i want this dvdbut i'll get it next monthjune when i have more money i love the star wars moviesespecially when luke skywalker and darth vader are fighting with lightsabersthat is so cool, i have starwars trilogy the laserdisc special edition remastered boxsetand i bought the ws dvd boxset tooone of my favorite movies , i am all mixed up with these reviews i want the original blu ray trilogy i have the complete saga but that is not the original i want original like they said here so i bought it is this the original vrs thanks, i was lucky enough to see star wars in the theatre in 1977 everyone who has seen it will never forget the scifi genius of the tale battles in outer space with wonderful special effects that instantly made everything else copy it once seen it is never forgotten the sequels are well done too, these three films are 3 of the best films ever made in the history of the movies these three  films have a great plot great acting and great special effects and great music the three films have great artistic merit and are very entertaining, this six disc bluray dvd movie set arrived intact and no sign of damage to either the discs or the case that the discs came in picture sound and features playback is superb i would recommend star wars episodes 4 to 6 to anyone who purchases it online, love this trilogy it's always a better deal to buy as a set great gift and good to have for dvd collectors because people always want to watch star wars it's a classic, i have all the star wars titles and am glad to see episodes iv v  vi released as a boxed set  the bonus dvd in this set is excellent  thank you george lucas  lucas arts, bought the complete set on blue ray episodes 1  6 since many of the ones we had were on vhs the picture clarity and definition really made them pop and more enjoyable, this has all the makings of an ancient japanese tale of revenge spirituality and good versus evil a fine retelling of feudal japan's mythos, this right here is only the original trilogy which is the best i like return of the jedi myself it also comes with the back in print dvd so if you don't want first 3 well this is the star wars set to get, love the series and em sohappy to be able to watch the first three movies over and over  cherie is so cute, love all six of the movies i ordered these a long time ago and just now giving a review these movies are classics that will go on for years and years, great to have digital versions to replace my vhs tapes and now bluray for future use they did reedit some of the scenes but overall was glad to have it fill my library of the story, this and the original theatrical versions are the ones i grew up on as a kid no stupid addin of hayden christensen at the end of return of the jedi and none of the other lucas improvement garbage i plan to get these converted to dvd, this is going to be a gift for our boys for the holidays i started early but at lease i know i have the movie when the time  come, what's not to love about the original star wars trilogy i grew up watching these movies and was so excited to find them in a set my kids have also enjoyed watching them this is a trilogy that will be loved for years to come, great collection last copy for original version before remaster  this movies are one of the best ever from this planet very orginal story cheap in amazon for be out of print and cheap and fast deliver, if you want some star wars this is itthe 3 original movies remastered together new hope and empire strikes back are amazing movies and return of jedi is great if you see 1 you got to see the sequence well done star wars, this was a gift for someone who knew nothing of star wars  we bought it as christmas gift  for the price you can beat this deal  love the package on amazon  thank you  love star wars, who can deny trilogy with episode 7 coming out later this year i like how they put in the alternate scenes into episode 4 where you first see jabba and bobba fett, our whole family are big star wars fans one grandson is a huge fan and requested these to finish his star wars movie collection he was very happy and they played great, the only way to see and keep this movie treasure trove i even have a new appreciation for the second generation of star wars films, excellent blu ray nice color and very well done transfer my favorite is the empire strikes back star wars a new hope is very good also, this series is a musthave for all star wars fans  the movies are all remastered in hd and include some deleted scenes as well as some added special effects, the better half of the star wars series but this version has the version where they inserted hayden at the end of return of the jedi, this is a collector's item i'm glad i got one i just let it sit in the midst of my other treasures i haven't opened it or anything i don't need to i've just glad to have it all in one package, it was so great to be able to watch the original trilogy in hd with surround sound i highly recommend this for any star wars enthusiast, we bought this and spent the entire time adjusting the volume since the dvd went from loud to low and back again  then the second show froze at the middle  terrible experience, great bonus content for the original star wars trilogy but wish it all made it on the bluray collection documentaries trailers and tv spots including the 1997 special edition trailer from the original trilogy, the only thing i can review about this is that it was well packaged i liked the movie on the big screen so i can't see how it will be different on bluray, i am hopefully that these will be remade in blu ray form without the edits to the originals  the one that really really bothers me is hayden christiansen as ghostspirit at the very end and it just bums me out to end on that note, this was an excellent purchase  i love star wars and to get the original star wars version on vhs i couldn't pass this up, the first time i saw this movie it blew my mind and i went to see it six more times and then bought the dvds and the seguels i must admit i don't like the the new 123 movies very much ill sticj with the 3 originals, will these new bluray discs have lucas' added cgi i always felt the added cgi was lame and on high definition bad cgi pops out please someone tell me if this is going to be the case, i love star war movies all of them this is more than just greatit's outstanding this set of star war will be watched over  over in my life time the best of the best in my time  next world to come, what can i say about this set that hasen't already been said  if you are a fan of the movies and don't own episodes 46 then i highly recommend buying this  the bonus 4th disc is a very nice touch  i found this set alot cheaper at a local retail store for around 40, i love the original trilogy of star wars it is far better than episodes 1 2 and 3 and far more memorable these will be around forever, i bought this for my 10 yearold grandson who suddenly found that reading the books for these was fun hurray he told me that he knew all the stories and gave me all the details he has them now, what can a star wars fan ask for oh all three original star wars movies in a box set well it happened this box set is awesome star wars is by far the best science fiction movies ever made george lucas is a genius thanks george for making such wonderful films, all star wars fans this is a dream come true all the three star wars films in on dvd boxset from a new hope to the return of the jedi also both versions too plus tons of extras join the dark side of the force and crush the rebel alliance this is a very cool boxset, there are no special features on these bluerays just some old audio commentaries compare this set to the great back to the future bluray box set which on each bluray has three hours of special features granted the picture and sound are better than the old dvds but thats it, i have purchased several previously viewed vhs tapes in the past and this was the best of the lot  all ran like brand new just made tpes, i have had these movies in vhs format but there never was any bonus features on how the movies were made or commentary it i nice to have the dvd so that i have these i am one for behind the scenes stuff  so it is great to have these now in my film library, had to have the classic star wars trilogy bought more for sentimental reasons than any other great classic movies a must see, if you are a fan and do not already have the set then you are not a sw fan that is just fact so for the new fans who need a set this is a great gift idea or even just to buy for yourself, i received the blue ray set in excellent condition  the colors are so vibrant i love seeing the original movies on bluraythank you, still enjoy it even though i've watched it many times great movie excellent acting special effects and oddball characters   overall a fun time watching it, the best star wars trilogy is these right here they are conveniantly packaged to take up less room the films have great picture quality, the really did an amazing job with the restoration any movie lover and star wars fan must have this in your collection in addition it is a smart trilogy to buy if you are thinking about the future star wars movies coming out, these are better than the dvd the picture is better and so is the sound i enjoyed watching these if you like star wars a must for any collection, i love the star wars movies i'm not sure why the director made the episodes out of order but these are a must for your movie collection who doesn't love r2 d2 these were an awesome price too, this review is for the original and unaltered versions of the 1st 3 discs black and silver box with darth on the front these are 3 of the best that scifi has to offer the transfer is 4 out of 5 and you know the rest of whats going on wo me rehashing it allsupport your favorite artists, star wars trilogy is what i was looking for i have the vhs versions of these movies when they first came out and i can't watch them because my vhs player doesn't work so now i have them on dvd so now i can watch them all over again, this is the set of films that set the mark for so many others to measure up to i saw the first one when it was first released must own type of films, these started it all the technology created to make these movies is commonplace now but when the first movie was released in theatres it was mindbogglinga must have, older star wars movies in this setbut still feel fresh and new like the very first timesuch a great scifi adventure moviesthings like these do not come out of hollywood very oftenso seat back and enjoyin blue ray it will be a real treat to your eyes, these dvds were replacements of the videos i had  got a good deal on them  i am a fan  right jar jar binks, my family own a version of this product star wars 4 5 and 6 are great movies to i had a great experience with a version of this product, the empire of dreams is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen and i have seen march of the penguins the other featurettes add an awesome bonus sparkle to this wonderful diamond that this dvd is with the documentary alone highly recommended, i love the films picture and sound are good only episode iv shows some age the commentary tracks are very informative i knocked one star off for the changes made to the films while some are cool additions others felt unnecessary, while not completely free of problems this is a sharp and colorful version of the earlier episodes  some of the colors areoutstanding while others look so so  sound is very good and when played through a good home theater system is impressive, the original trilogy  presented in widescreen  i know blu ray has since come and trumped this set but for the price it is nice to add to collection, this movie is the best of the best of space movies it givees you an insight to what goes on to try to win the war on evil i would recommend this saga to all my friends and family great actors and wonderful senery great costums too, what can i say this is my childhood  even now there are moments in these three movies that still thrill me  and let's give some credit for the series staying power  for certain age groups peradolescence it still has appeal, this movie is good for a lot of bellylaughs  more importantly it contains several profound lessons about the nature of happiness  and what could be more important than that  one of my ten alltime favorite movies]</td>\n","

and there but the storyline and direction is brilliant  looking forward to the sequel as soon as it arrives, watching this felt like rewatching green lantern xmen except it was slower and less interesting  i think teenagers and old people might enjoy this but we felt bored and cannot recommend this movie to anyone  it felt like a waste of time  watch xmen instead, i could only appreciate this mindless entertainment for a brief window of my life and that window has been boarded up  please stop making more than one movie every other year like this thank you, i absolutely loved the other underworld films but this one felt rushed with poor story development a bad pace and some fairly terrible cgi graphics, i believe you're more likely to enjoy this movie if you're young  the action in this movie felt unbelievable and lacked anything to really draw me into the story  the special effects were exaggerated which i enjoy but nothing that impressive  if you've seen the original this movie will probably be a let down, i wouldn't recommend this to anyone with anything going on  you can have a more enjoyable time stacking rocks or folding clothes  if you are considering this or shoving sand go shovel sand, everything felt fake and hollywoodified throughout this movie  from the scenes to the acting to the makeup i just could not enjoy this movie because of it, this wasn't quite a matrix or inception but it was great nonetheless  i'd recommend this for anyone  the storyline is interesting the dialogue isn't too predictable the ending isn't mind blowing but i enjoyed the whole ride, there was nothing very interesting about this movie i would only recommend this to you if you're very bored and have seen every other movie out, i enjoyed day watch a little more but this movie is great  the special fx are just as nice as part two  it's too bad this movie is more well known in the states  it's better than 300 in my opinion and almost as good as the matrix, after watching bsg i immediately moved to caprica and was instantly disappointed  i did not finish watching the season  a year later craving bsg i gave caprica another try and fell in love with it's slower pace and less stressful scenarios  it's much more mild but it's good, i didn't imagine it possible but amc has turned a post apocalyptic zombie thriller into a boring soap opera  the silly interpersonal relationship issues are just ridiculous and drag on and on  with very sparse sprinkles of zombie action this show has become a dud, this movie along with lock stock and two smoking barrels are tremendous  the characters are fun and solid the story is fun it really was the peak of these types of films  this is a must see classic, the storyline is slow and uneventful  the characters are boring  it lost my interest almost immediately  i found this show just as lame as your average marketers commercial idea, this storyline fills in a lot of details  background that lead into the original wizard of oz and it does so wonderfully  magical  if you were unable to enjoy this movie you need to get on prozac or something, there was nothing that drew me into this movie  i wanted to find some aspect that was worth saying something positive about but i saw none  don't watch this for any reason, there's nothing really new in this movie it's not mind blowing it's marginally suspenseful in moments much of it is unbelievable  too good to be true but it's not bad  i'd recommend watching it on a boring day, starting with episode 8 in february this show has made a complete turnaround for the good  the long drawn out emotional soapopera scenes have taken a back seat to real action  suspense  i recommend any newcomers watch the first 4 episodes of season 1 and then skip everything up until season 2 episode 8 nebraska, this movie tries and fails to capture the spirit  awesomeness of snatch and lock stock  two smoking barrels  i wouldn't recommend this film for anyone it was hard to finish watching  if you're about to watch this don't instead rent snatch or lock stock  two smoking barrels, you'll find more invigorating excitement mowing the lawn  hollywood has lost touch i just can't get into the same old story rehashed over and over and over and over, this is a fantastic movie  the story is fun the characters are neat  rocknrolla was a horrible piece of trash but this film is definitely a must see, the special effects aren't top notch the character costumes are a bit dated and the scene lighting is outdated but the story is fun the dialogue dorky  interesting  if you like doctor who and battlestar galactica this feels like a fun mashup of them both with a twist of labyrinth  i enjoyed episode 1, just terrible  i cannot express adequately how terrible this film is  just don't bother  it is weak dull and failed to capture my interest at all  terrible, so far it seems that every female actor is aboveaverageattractive which nags my realisticradar but i can't blame the casting director  the stories are pretty good some of the dialogues  character relationships lack originality but overall i enjoy this show on a rainy day, this movie is amazing the story is intense the action is great special fx are beautiful and the subtitles are very clever, the costume fx aren't all that good though the vampires look like clowns turned methzombies  but the storyline  action is entertaining, these transformer movies are horrible  the special effects are the only good thing about these movies  the actors especially the main actor have drab storylines stupid dialogue and the transformer voices are poor  unless you're a kid this movie is not for you, i didn't have high expectations it's ninja turtles after all but i thought it'd at least be entertaining  i fast forwarded through most of it and the actor they cast as april o'neil is a cliche of a cliche with no personality, first started watching this anime when it came on toonami its a good series but i ended up missing a few of the shows and some important parts but now that i have it on dvd i can enjoy it in my home as part of my growing collection]</td>\n","      <td>[i won't be wronged i won't be insulted and i won't be laid a hand on i don't do these things to other people and i require the same from them, this sequel qualifies for the not up to the standard of the originalthe plot is weak and the acting subpar  definitely does not live up to the original nor does it live up to the introduction, this movie was ok it was not anything too special it was worth the watch but not one i would want to watch over and over, it was good in its own but the original was definately better in my book  the view of the future in this on is much darker and tech is much lower the motor cycles they use are barely more than standard motor cycles, it's a slow motion blood fest  i feel like they chose a drug that makes life feel like slow motion for the picture just so they could have more slow motion stuff  if you like 300 or sin city you might love this one though, this is a great sience fiction movie despite the story is very simple there was a lot of action no deathboring moments i think this was somewhat better then the original one, i watched it and thought this was one violent film i think the dredd movie from the nineties was better entertainment because this movie took itself too seriously for my liking it needed to lighten up, i loved this movie karl urban is perfect in this role and the special effects are outstanding i hope it is a continuing franchise highly recommended, i thought sequels were supposed to be related to the original movies the only thing close here is that i spent money on this on like i did on the other don't rent or buy, his new girl partner with her special gifts excited me  keeping me in wonder of what she will find in the minds of evil convicts  she would know what they were thinking  it made this movie spectacular, this movie needs a sequel it is smart and action packed story was amazing enemies are also great you will not be dissapointed, it was pretty bloody a lot of action but it was good i wasn't sure if i would like it or not but i would give it a thumbs up, like blood and guts and tons of empty shell casings flying everywhere then you will love this movie if you liked robo cop then you will love judge dredd, different spin on judge dredd good splatter film with some humor mixed with great violence necessary of course not but grab some popcorn and lay down the plastics sheet to catch the spillover, i've seen 3d movies in both imax and normal 3d format and this has to be the best ever  brings dredd back to the way he should be not the silly version they had in the stallone movie, this movie was much better than i expected it to be good twists along the way and good albeit somewhat predictable ending, i enjoyed the original judge dredd starring sylvester stallone many years ago and thought this would be a good update or sequel instead dredd was dreddful don't know how this project ever got greenlighted, when i saw the commercials i expected a modern version of the original but i was wrong it looks like a 8090s film done in the 8090s was i entertained yes would i watch it again no would i buy it no, good action with lots of futuristic tools for law enforcement  but pretty much a crime doesn't pay theme throughout pretty standard stuff, i didn't think i'd like the movie as much as i did  i bought it more out of curiosity and the fact that the price was right  turns out i enjoyed it more than i thought  no oscar nominations but decent fun, don't compare the two movies  this is a scifi b movie  watch it for what it is not for what it isn't  the special effects are well done, four stars and i don't give those lightly  it didn't follow the hollywood formula about the evil authority in the future  the authority was the good guys  and the sets were interesting  i went into to just looking for something to watch i've burned out prime badly  but it was really good, i love scifi films set in the dystopian future  good special effects and good characters make this movie stand out  i hope there's going to be a sequel, god save america i'm 66 and i have never seen a worst example of a movie in my life too muck gore  violence  i fell bad for the kids who watch this movie, lame story line regretted renting this about 12 way through it just numerous scenes of heavy gun fire that last for extended periods of timeridiculous story line and just a b rate scifi movie skip this unless you are desperate to watch something stupid, one thousand times better than judge dredd   i watch this movie 3 times a weekand i can't stop , something went wrong with this film they didn't make the money they wanted to greed but it was amazing and karl urban was phenomenal as dredd, this movie was a good sci5 but had some boring parts leading up to the plot  other than that it passed the time, i put off watching this film for some time as i liked the original film however after watching this version of the filmstory i thought it was better than the original and karl urban is a better dredd than sylvester stallone its a good film with an interesting story and lots of action, this remake was ok i didn't love it but i didn't hate itits a good midnight mindless movie to watch and kill time withits hard to remake classicsthe visuals were fun but the actors and plot just couldn't make me a fan for life, not the remake i expected but it was ok i like a movie with lots of action but i think they left the ending openended, i found dredd to be a very good movie i would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys action movies it's a bit futuristic but i enjoyed it thanksjohn, it is a rather dark movie with tons of graphic violence however i knew that going in i was however very happy with the movie and didn't understand the entire plot until the end good movie, it is a good movie for those who like plenty of action with dred giving it to the bad guys however it is very violent and graphic special effects, this film really was a surprise extremely entertaining and action packed highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun watch two thumbs up, picks up from the old stallone judge dredd movie if you liked the original forget it and you'll like this future copjudge that dispenses justice as required by the law this would really be the way to do it but it will never happen because it would put a few million lawyers out of work, this version is top notch although the violence and gore is a reminder of 300 and the series spartacus but with bullets instead of blades this dredd is dirty harry on steroids plus the fact you never see dredd's full face adds a mysterious element to the character as well, i was actually surprised how awesome this movie was karl urban made a great judge dredd and the action was awesome i wanted more when the movie was over and i hope they make another, enjoyable flick and much better than the stallone movie judge dredd a lot of dark future movies have ridiculous set ups but the action can be tons of fun much better than i expected, the movie is made well  acting is also good  if you are into scifi and action you will enjoy the movie  lots of action not much character development  good watch though, captures the look feel and ugliness of mega city worth every credit paid for the great blu ray smart and tight great casting, this is a all on one disk and not a 3 disk set as it would lead you to think i buy sets because the dvds get used everywhere and by everyone including grand kids and i would not pay this for one disk it does not make sense, the movie has a great visual style with a unique use of color the violence is gruesome and the movie earns its r rating karl urban is great as dredd the only problem i had was with mama the villain lena headey is given nothing to work with otherwise a very enjoyable movie, i was thrown off by this movie i thought it was better and it was  just ok and kinda like other sci fi movies and prodicable and dredd was the doctor from star trak, i liked it watch it on a sunday afternoon on my kindle fire hd with the prime if you like action this is the movie for you, this is one of the few well crafted action movies of late  of course if you cannot stand shoot em up movies then this is definitely not for youthe tension between dredd and his trainee created a sense of realism for me which is difficult to relay in a scifi setting, the movie continues where the other movies left off  your basic carnage cool weapon systems and dumb criminals throw in a psychic some corrupt judges and a cool new drug and you have the recipe for a pretty good movie if you like this kind of violence and justice, nice fun action movie a little scifi and a little cop drama all in all a fun departure from the humdrum cookie cutter movies out there, i didn't see this in theaters because i thought it was going to be bad and now i feel stupid  it's an excellent action film and it deserved my support at the theaters  karl urban was perfect for judge dredd and if action flicks could be given awards this one would have been nominated, i purchased this movie a few months ago and watched it recently  it was pretty good i liked it  if you are familiar with the dredd series comics and stories this movie is pretty good  cant wait for dredd 2  good storyline and special effects, this movie is completely different from the first  i don't know what the body count was for this movie was but i'm sure it was way more than the first one if you like gratuitous violence this movie has it, decent futuristic dystopian movie much more realistic than the stallone version a must have for any 3d movie collection i hope they make a sequel, if you like a lot of action and bloody violence this movie is for you i do like a good action film but this was a bit too bloody and gory for my taste  i'm sure younger folks who play violent video games would love this film, no deep plot no romance  just lots of stuff blowing up  it's what we wanted and what we got  if you expect shakespeare watch something else  , well you could certainly tell that the director and producers like the original moviethe new judge dred resembles the first almost to a t in some casesdefinetly better than the first moviebut not by leap years, loved this from the start to finish initially thought it was a little lame but 5 minutes later it kept me on edge for the rest of the movie with great special effects and lots of action  worth the 4 it cost to rent it, i loved this movie i really hope they make a sequel  no where near as goofy and campy as the original but better, nicely done remake of the original same premise but entirely different story  a little claustrophobic but lots of action and as expected a high body count  due to language limited sexual images and violence not suitable for anyone under young adult age, i was surprised that i enjoyed this film as much as i dida previous outing with sylvester stallone was abyssmalhowever although his verbal contribution was minimal his physical presence was spot on, dark gritty and earned it's rratingthere is a time and a place for movies like this just wish hollywood would make more, better than stallone's dredd i reckon  nice and violent but some of the effects were wishy washy  one of these days they may do it justice, this was one of the best new cyberpunk movies i've seen in a long time a really great movie for this genre and i can't wait for the sequel, an excellent action movie i discovered this movie late night on an instant stream and absolutely loved it direct simple plot and great action sequences loved the actors in it and could not recommend this movie enough, this story is way over the top with violence that did not need to be shown at all times for every attack on a human being the imagination can easily fill in for any end result from violence but it interferes with moving the story along, i did not know what to expect of this movie  at first it was so graphically violent that i almost quit watching  as the movie went along it wasn't so graphic and ended up being entertaining, only fair  it's an okay movie and slightly entertaining but it drags quite a bit and is very much not true to the original story, good movie digital code still worked case was damaged before being plastic wrapped so i imagine it happened at the factory it was packaged inbesides that it had a great price and shipped fast a, this movie isn't for the squeamish but if you're watching dredd chances are you know what you're in for and this movie doesn't disappoint  sooo much better than the stallone farce, wow  what a pleasant surprise  nothing like the stalone original which was nothing but campy fun  this dredd delivered an effective grim reality take on the character which was refreshing  btw  sound and video was excellent here  recommended, great cyberpunk it is dark dangerous and delightful to watch this is a must see for all action scifi and cyberpunk fans good story and great action, was extremely disappointed it this movie it was more like watching someone playing a game was boring  the first judge dredd was good was expected more of the same but didn't get it, this is the judge dredd that will make graphic cartoon followers happy that they waited  this is amazing in 3d and it's nice to have the digital copy available, this movie was interesting  i would give it 35 starsworth watching if you have time to killbetter than the stalone judge dredd, ok but boring all dark better plot needs some help too predictiablebut ok for being in the future they had bad comunication devices but again that is why it was a movie and not for real right they should have called scotty and had more beamed down to help them, 2012r just plain sucks guess i just don't get it tall building dredd  blah  blah  blah even stalone was better and that wasn't great mfjlabs 2x, i was very surprised  love the character and the show was very good  a lot of action and a strong support for character story, couldn't watch it all i was thinking that it was gonna be good like when sly stallone is in it it's a good treatment for insomnia though, found this movie much better especially the acting than the 1995 movie of the same name  better plot and acting  lots of blood and guts but you have to expect that from a judge  highly recommended for action and sf lovers, i still like the stallone dredd better  this dredd is ok the action is great but the acting    well for as bad as stallone was he was still better than this, this movie was better than i expected but even though for the most part karl urban did a good acting job i just couldn't get over he is not sylvester stallone nor does he sound like him, this thing goes downhill after the first 15 minutes it seems as though the budget runs out at the 15 min mark 85 of this movie takes place inside of a building the storyline is different than the original but that isn't a good thing as dredd is barely watchable, a pretty good movie with enough special effects to keep your attention  rather stark and dreary set of a highrise apartment building in the not to distant future, save yourself the money and time and look elsewhere no plot just low budget bloody goo the actors want to go home, decent movie good effects and definitely action packed not the best storyline and acting but its entertaining if you want to see it rent it from redbox, i don't remember much about the original which was probably good because i didn't sit there comparing the two  overall a good movie, more darker than the original version but much better maybe sandra bullock killed it for me in the first one with stallone but i was pleasantly suprised by this one guns blazing, if you like scarey violent and quick to the point you'll like dredd it started off downright violent and continued to the end i grew to like it a bit more when the star of the show was judge jury and trial all rolled up into one, this is a well made film with solid acting and production values  the plot is interesting if not generic or a copy of 'the raid' with a bit of 'die hard'  the main problem is that the story about a cop that polices a future 'mega' city takes place in a locked down building, karl urban is really good but the production value of this was a 4 out of 10 my teen sons loved it but typical dark future slums  ala robocop which i detested somehow i have more hope for mankind, it was great to watch again i remember watching it in the theatre and it's still as great as ever i would recommend it to anyone to buy, when i first saw this movie i didn't like it but upon rewatching it i found it very entertaining 100 better than the stallone version, i would recommend this to any one who loves a good action movie set in the future a place that is beset by lawless and corrupt men a place where only the best lawmen keep order  and peace, this is no work of art but it is fun to watch karl urban does a good job i say it's worth watching probably not a buy just rent, i watched the 2d version on dvd when it came out and i liked it so i bought the 3d version when i got a 3d tv the 3d version is far superior and definitely the way it should be viewed, all i can say this was a pretty boring movie dull and lack luster for most of the movie that is until everyone starts blowing things up, i remember the disappointment of watching stallone destroy dredd  thank god urban is the perfect dredd  the story acting and special effects are far superior to the now forgotten sly version, it wasn't as good as the original judge dredd got a kick out of how the main character always looked pissed off thought the scenery was pretty good but the movie was too long, wish i'd owned stock in the company that sold red dye 5 good plot but a bit much on the gory side for those with weak stomachs, awesome glad i got this item it works great it does the job great i received this item so quick i was blown away, judge dredd is the definition of bad a this movie is pretty gory but that's how the comic was perceived and i'm not complaining through out the movie dredd's weapons and actions make you get excited and bumped every time he does something i'd recommend this movie to my guy friends, ...]</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>4.77966</td>\n","

is not the best movie in the world but scarlett is simply too hot to resist  yes the story is so full of sxxx but as a sucker for scarlett johansson it is a four star in my book, not bad at all  although there are a few holes here and there the movie has good special effects and the movie flows along from one part to another  i am not a spiderman fan but even i enjoyed this long movie  this movie is definitely worth watching, this is one solid action packed movie  pierce was convincing as a actor and i thought he did a good job  without spoiling the movie i thought there was a part of the movie where bleeding was not needed  nonetheless this movie is recommended, javier bardem is the star in the movie  he is a cold ruthless psychotic and calm killer  without getting into the details this hit man is definitely not the kind of person you want to mess with  great acting plus original script make this an interesting movie to watch, this is one ridiculous movie but it is fun to watch from the beginning to the end  it is action packed and i loved it, lucy is not the best movie in the world but scarlett is simply too hot to resist  yes the story is so full of sxxx but as a sucker for scarlett johansson it is a four star in my book, i like the script the acting and the morality with this movie  it is at time nerve wrecking to watch even though it is only a fictitious

movie  it is one of the biggest pos movies i have ever seen in my life  it is a terrible waste of having good actors in this movie  read up on other negative reviews to get an idea on just how terrible this dog is, director ang lee is getting better and better in telling stories  the bluray version of the movie will bring out the best of a great television set  the movie was so well made two plus hours went by very quickly, i have seen a lot of movies in my life  this movie is truly one of a kind  it is full of actions real pyro effects and interesting characters  my wife is not a big action flick person but even she loved the movie  just watch it, liam neeson and other unknown cast members did a superb job in this movie  the movie is bloody violent creepy and suspenseful  it is a winner, melissa mccarthy rocks in this movie  she managed to pull it off with her bizarre character  my wife and i enjoyed watching this crazy movie, the good some interesting gun battle shotsthe bad lousy car chase  lousy scriptthe strange more russian bad guys typical hollywood crap  most russian people are law obeying citizenswhy is nicolas cage making so many movies lately  most of them are no good  what is going on, gina is the star in this movie  compared to the lame ass keanu reeves she can deliver a real kick  it is unfortunate they didn't allow her to show off her killer ab  i ended up watching this movie twice in one night because i enjoyed watching her kicking butts, seriously speaking casual sex as portrayed in the movie is down right dangerous  hiv genital warts or herpes could get you killed  i love justin and mila but this whole fxxx buddy scheme between the headhunter and the internet guy just doesn't seem likely, come on  this movie is too lame and tame  i am only giving it two stars because it reminds me of some wild party days in college, i have seen thousand of movies in my life time however i have never seen an actual ostrich riding movie just that alone is worth the price of admission, i loved watching the blokes fighting the invaders  however the movie basically tells the same old friends from school story  some people became successful and some struggled in life  minus one star because i didn't like how the movie finished at the very end, i used to love eddie murphy  lately he is just plain terrible  this movie sucks and it was pretty much a waste of time, the movie started out good but it gradually deteriorated to the point of no recovery to me it wasn't a chernobyl experience  it was a totally waste of time experience  read some other onestar or twostar reviews before you buy or rent this movie  there are tons of negative reviews out there, this action packed movie is actually a well put together movie  good acting and believable story are the strong points  i really enjoyed all 100 minutes of it  recommended, denzel the bad ass ex special force is simply too much of a person even for his own good  this movie is violent and exciting to watch  100 recommended, slavery is wrong and it created many problems for this country  my redneck brotherinlaw came from a racist family and some of the stuff he said made me cringe  i wish he would watch this movie and try to understand how wrong slavery is, the last part of the movie was great  the beginning chase scene was also fun to watch  yes there were some parts of the movie that are ridiculous but overall it is a much much better movie than cowboys and aliens  if you like zoe you will love her in this movie, seriously speaking casual sex as portrayed in the movie is down right dangerous  hiv genital warts or herpes could get you killed  i love justin and mila but this whole fxxx buddy scheme between the headhunter and the internet guy just doesn't seem likely, even emma watson couldn't save this dog poop  even though the movie did include some facts the movie simply sucksdon't waste your time, what an interesting movie  i like almost everything about the movie  rosario dawson is totally hot but james maavoy's pale rear end made me want to puke  vincent cassel did a great job in this movie as well  great acting good original script nudity violence and explosion  one good movie to watch, i have seen a lot of movies in my life  this movie is truly one of a kind  it is full of actions real pyro effects and interesting characters  my wife is not a big action flick person but even she loved the movie  just watch it, i like the movie but i didn't think the sex part was necessary  additionally exit wounds and blood splattering from gun shots didn't look real all  this movie is a solid fourstar for war movie fans, i never liked dazel washington and ryan reynolds nevertheless they did a fantastic job in this movie  this movie is full of actions and the script was well written  great job, gina is the star in this movie  compared to the lame ass keanu reeves she can deliver a real kick  it is unfortunate they didn't allow her to show off her killer ab  i ended up watching this movie twice in one night because i enjoyed watching her kicking butts, this is not a bad movie  i like the story and the technology  however if they had those reconstructive machines how come some of those people still have bad teeth, the beginning of the movie was ridiculous  however as the movie progresses my wife and i were glued to the tv and we couldn't believe just how amazing the fighting were choreographed it is definitely worth watching if you are a martial art fan, what happened to jackie  not only is he getting older lately his movies are terrible  does he need money  no  what's up with 1911 and what's up with this movie  does he not want to leave his legacy behind, explosions  yescar chase scenes  yeshelicopters  yesforeigners who can speak english  yesyippee ki yay mother xxxxx  yesbottom line watch this movie if you like all of the above  this movie requires no thinking, great acting  i have never been a big fan of jack but i admire his acting skills  i must say this is his best acting movie by far  obviously it helps to have another great costar  without spoiling the movie just watch it  after watching the movie i have started my own bucket list, i have seen many movies in my life  this movie is well made original and fascinating to watch  no wonder so many people gave it five stars  100 recommended, i have just finished watching the movie  i didn't know what to expect since it is a sequel  in my opinion it is probably one of the best animation movies from dreamworks  the movie is funny and action packed strongly recommended, i don't mind blood but the ending is just too much for me  the movie twisted historic facts and i am wondering if the director was high on crack when he made the movie, you simply cannot go wrong with this movie  great special effects decent acting and cool battlefight parts  having said that i don't think this movie is suitable for little kids due to violence and blood, i hate to say this but adam sandler is actually getting better and better  having said that his acting skill started at the nadir so it has no where to go but up  this movie is predictable and the violence is unnecessary not recommended, trust the low scoring reviews  this movie sucks yodon't waste your time  miss gomez did not take it offdon't expect people to pop a cap muchdo expect lousy acting, although part of this movie makes no sense the last 30 minutes of the battle in the movie was climatic  it is definitely a different type of film that you do not see made here in the western world, this is a very funny movie  i have seen it many times and i still find it extremely funny each time  yes it is very silly  but the one of a kind talking tongue is a mustseewatch it and have a few good laughs, this movie has a few funny moments but it is pretty much a huge waste of my time  this is my last steve carell movie, ben sucksowen sucksdustin sucksbarbara sucksjessica alba saved the day  her amazing body and her warm friendly smile are mesmerizing  btw de niro was great, after making mostly crappy movies keanu finally did a much better job in the movie  this movie is fairly entertaining to watch  minus one star because exit wounds from rifle shots did not look realistic and some of the shootings looked too fake mainly due to keanu's inability to make it look real, i have just finished watching the movie  i didn't know what to expect since it is a sequel  in my opinion it is probably one of the best animation movies from dreamworks  the movie is funny and action packed strongly recommended, the movie is so full of hot air  clive owen should just quit his acting job  he sucks and he cannot act  he ruined the movie, you simply cannot go wrong with this movie  great special effects decent acting and cool battlefight parts  having said that i don't think this movie is suitable for little kids due to violence and blood, this is one of tom's best movies  i love the story and the droids  i would love of have one of those neat space craft  if you like an original scifi movie check it out, wow my wife and i didn't expect this movie to be so action packed funny and interesting  highly entertaining and recommended, this movie is ok i don't watch it very often i have to be in a rare kind of mood to pop this one in]</td>\n","      <td>[for a film with no oral script it was mildly captivating  it is hard to imagine surviving this kind of disaster and not just giving up, i have always been a fan of robert redford but has he gotten to the point where he will stoop to be in such a uneventful movie as thisi was totally disappointed  aside from whatever was paid redford for being in the moviethis movie couldn't have cost over a few thousand dollars and two days to complete, we were very impressed with this movie there was very little talking but it was exciting  it reminded us of the movie with tom hanks on the island by himself , for a movie with next to no dialogue i thought it was pretty gripping  redford is at his best and you watch this movie unfold and wonderwowwhat's he going to do next  i loved this movie  the photography was incredible  i highly recommend this film, it wasn't the big cliff hanger of the year and it didn't leave me sitting on the edge of my seat but the acting was good and the story decent, not that much this movie is a redford movie all of it it stars only robert and it ends with only robert i like movies when people are lost at sea but this was a little bit too predictable and it gave me a feeling of'frustration ' i guessdidn't like it, there he is still precise capable selfcontained indomitable commanding beliefstill squinting into the sun calculating the odds looking for the way throughstill not complaining resigned to hostile fortune still finding something good in it, i was surprised as to the lack of characters and dialogue  but i was not disappointed in the least  lots of actions and redford did an excellent portrayal of a man lost at sea and his will to survive, i am sure that mr redford got plenty of bucks to play the part in this movie and get wet over and over again but it was totally unbelievable for a man this age and i think he of course said about four words, robert redford did well to keep the interest going in this film for me i am sure i would not watch it again but the punch line is that you have to watch it to the end to see if he does or doesn't, with it being robert redford i did expect it to be a little better  i also feel that in real life someone in this situation would of been talking outloud to themselves a lot more  not sure i would take the time to watch it again, good movie for getting the idea of the sailboat in all of kinds of bad luck but a bit dry i realized how important the land is to me after this movie, this movie kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time the only thing that was weird there was no dialog for the entire movie, this movie was good but it didn't feel original  i felt like i was watching a mix of castaway and life of pi  meh, this was a very intense movie that was well shot i'm a redford fan already and i expected nothing less this movie will not let you relax from beginning to end the dialogue will surprise you, a silent movie simple movie powerful well done it should be watched and watched again i enjoyed myself  very much , barely got through it think we needed more than the 20 or so words expressed by robert redford too bad as i usually like and respect his work, this dvdmovie is okay  it's not as grand and great as i was lead to believe  i had expected a little more from redford  the dvd itself was fine no flaws problems or issues, i like sailboats and that is why i rented this movie  i thought that the one and only character was a little stupid at times when he tried to deal with his problems and didn't like the end as you do not know what happened to him did he go to heaven or was he rescued, i was intrigued to see how much i would like the movie since i knew it had hardly any dialougei thoroughly enjoyed the movie  i was immediately immersed in the movienot having any dialougue was not missed once it startedeven my young kids stayed with the movierme, this review is made on the blu ray disc of the movie movie  45  5video  4 5  5audio  5  5guess what i loved it watched it three times alreadyand enjoyed it every timegreat drama about survival at all costsrecommended addition for your blu collection, to those who get this thinking man's or woman's story  you will love it to those who don't  there is always the next season of american idol to look forward to, could have been better if there was more of a story behind why this guy was there to begin with by himself and most inexperienced  watch the movie castaway instead, this movie made me see sick'  the acting is great but it is so slow in movement and action that it is boring  redford moves so slowly that i found myself quickly losing interest in whether he survives  all time is lost in this movie, to bad you can't put less then one star  redford you can tell he is getting old  he forgot all his lines, here is a film with very few words spoken and a lot of environmental conflict faced by a man stuck out at sea  redford will make you root for him as he suffers and struggles to survive, i never heard any thing about this movie i am a great fan of robert  redford so when i watched this movie i was so shocked that i had to watch the entire thing to see how it ends i won't go into detail so if you are really interested in it you will be surprised too lol, not redford's best work  i would have liked to have known what made him decide to go out in the middle of nowhere by himself did he lose his wife was he divorced was he a good person not enough information on the character to keep my interest, this is the only actor who could have held my attention during this boring film  it was interesting at first but became slow and monotonous after awhile, an entertaining story redford looked the part of a grizzled old sailor and the movie mostly moved along reasonably  for anyone who has actually been at sea in stormy conditions the eggbeater effect is likely much more pronounced than that depicted in the movie but it conveyed the mood, it is sort of like watching tom hanks but tom at least talked to himself i talk to myself more than this dude did i couldn't stand the silence and hated the ending this movie is all personal preferance watch at your own risk, so difficult to watch it is so gripping and real it is right up there with the very best for acting directing filming ect, it's not very often any more when a great film is made and delivered  robert redford gives an outstanding performance in this movie where the plot is all about survival  the filming was outstanding and redford's emoting without saying a word was something to behold  this movie is for the serious film fan, seen this movie but after all the reviews i am sure it is fabuloushope you will see it as well, i am sorry i ever contributed to his career i regret every dime i put into his pocket  he lacks character and has become a complete elitist snob he ego is all he cares about, a great performance by robert redford  this is a unique movie in that there's almost no dialog but redford pull it off beautifully  this movie keeps your attention, this movie's intensity grows continuously and illustrates why those unprepared should keep their feet on terra firma  prepare for high seas and batten down the hatches have meaning in this ever worsening tale takes shape, it is totally a movie where you catch yourself saying what could possibly happen nextand then you find out  good movie glad i watched itwhich is really hard for me to say about most movies any more, this has to be the most boring pictures i have ever sat through  the acting is goodit has to be as there are only 2 lines in the whole film, robert redford plays a solo act in this magnificant film that will keep you right on the dot with what his character is thinking and also feeling what he must be feelingthis is a great filmandhe pulls it off with just less than five wordsrent itit is worth it, the story of a sailor stuck in the ocean trying to survive made a great film  i thought robert redford acted well it kept me interested till the endi would recommend it, it is almost entirely robert redford talking with some action it is superb non the less because you are pulled into the story of his struggle to survive and the ending is not what you expect, in one of the best films of 2013 robert redford gives a career best performance in this strippedbare survival film a poetic moving and one of a kind movie that every cinephile should see, i enjoyed this movie i'm really into movies that have substance to them and this was a very original type movie i like how it literally showed step by step what this man did to survive and i thought it was very thought provoking and interesting, omg this is intense and riveting i can't wait to watch again my husband has trouble hearing conversation and because there is none in this film it is one he loved too, not quite as good as the very similar castaway but all and all still very good water scenes  were very good and believable robert redford's acting was superb, love this film amazing that it has not dialogue it may not be for everyone but for me i was on the edge of my seat the whole time, all is lost  no not all just the ten bucks i spent on this lousy pile of manure  wonder how long it took robert to learn his lines for this sleeper  save your money and go watch the grass grow  it will be a lot more entertaining, i really like this movie redford is strong as always and the story is one that you can find believable  one of the best solo performances ive seen since castaway with tom hanks, if you don't mind silence and want to learn some opensea survival tactics the fresh water recovery is worth watching the whole movie this is the movie for you redford is excellent if not a bit aged hard to watch the golden boy turn geriatric  love the end which almost ends redford, unique on the quiet side still dramatic interesting well written i wish the ending were better still i loved it  best to be prepared out on the ocean spooky at times, i think redford did a great job with this movie he did a great job depicting the loneliness of someone isolated at sea the fortitude and adaptability to deal with adverse circumstances then the resignation of someone realizing that there is no hope of rescue, robert redford did an excellent job he was alone in the movie so no dialog it did not always keep my interest but then again you did have to watch constantly because anything could change in a moment in the water, i love man against the elements stories but  not this one  unrealistic ending very little prestory worth a watch if you see it for free with amazon prime but i wouldn't recommend paying to see it, redford was great as always  but really inadvertently setting fire to the life raft you're in  it made no sense  who would do that, it's pretty awful all around but hey how many more times are we gonna get to see redford do his thing it's worth the ticket just to see this film icon do his thing even if the restricted story line leaves us with watching him prepare to die for an hour after the storm blows away, you will see the worth in this very fine film  i am glad i ignored the negative reviews  have some faith in redford and do the same, i like that the film started into the story immediately  it was well acted and held your interest the entire time i kept taking mental notes in case i was ever in the same predicament, if your bored and nothing to do this is a good movie it is one man lost at sea and that is the whole movie, a different kind of movie  if you tire of mindless dialogue in a lot of films these days you will appreciate this production  and you won't have trouble keeping up with the cast and characters  and just when you think all is lost   a gripping tale of survival, all is lost is just another version of cast away and gravity  a one actor movie that is predictable  don't waste your time, redford's recent movies  watch a man take on the wilderness bear ocean   alone  why  because he wants the screen all to himself  and sorry but he's not really a good enough actor to do that, we enjoyed this although it had very few words and one actor  it is amazing what one person can accomplish in a movie like this and the ending well it gave you opportunity to draw your own conclusion  i won't tell you mine so it will not ruin it for you, this man just wouldn't give up on life no matter what happened to him on his journey hope was there you've got to see this to believe it, if you are a sailor you would appreciate this film more than others  i am a sailor and i fast forwarded a few parts and as if i didn't miss a beat, interesting almost silent movie you would have to be an experienced sailboat person to totally understand all the equipment and things he did but it was a great yet lonely survival movie, extremely slow action had to skip ten minutes ahead a few times just to keep myself interested in what the ending would be redford never should have won any awards with this acting hollywood must have felt sorry for him i would not recommend you watch this unless you enjoy being bored stiff, hard to believe that a man with no particular sailing skills and a boat that is not seaworthy would get himself in such a predicament  nice ending though, it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be not as bad as sandra bullock floating through space anyway this is the kind of movie you'd watch once because it's robert redford but wouldn't bother watching again, decent movie a little castawayesqe not a ton of dialog  interesting concept and probably pretty realistic in portraying being out to sea, there is one person in this movie there is one guy a boat for a while then a raft and whole lot of water there's really not much more to say about it i was lucky and saw it on netflix so it didn't cost me anything, not your normal hollywood movie  what a relief this is a story where in the guy does everything right and the challenges do not stop keeps you watching and involved, this is a fastpaced wellacted and directed crime drama i thought the cast was excellent and the writing was intelligent i'm anxious to see another season]</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>4.75743</td>\n","      <td>3.75743</td>\n","      <td>14.1183</td>\n","      <td>Trust the numerous one star reviews.

clouds  really, pretty good story line   wahlbergs character however is not the brightest bulb in the box and some of his judgements were pretty far fetched  keeps you thinking, movie starts out well but turns into a story about alchaholism  good acting but very melancholy and tedious  not a great feeling when it's over, really lousey movie  got thru about a third of it before i turned it off  acting and plot and just about everything was sub par, good actionbut less than satisfactory ending  seemed as if they didn't know how to end the thing  decent experience anyway, pretty much a rip off of men in black  similar concept and production  was humorous and a fun movie to watch but not very original, once you get by the total unbelievability of the story line this is fun to watch  nice effects  giants in the clouds  really, a very compelling documentary  probably to be expected from corporate america but troubling nonetheless just another example of exploiting nature for the benefit of a few, wasn't really much of a science fiction movie  mostly a boy to man movie about survival  very disappointing acting was also sub par, lots of action and tongue in cheek banter  if not taken very seriously it is fun to watch  does make you wonder where they got there witch weapons however, good acting and pretty tense  dissappointed to find out it deviated considerably from the real incident  probably wouldn't have been as exciting if it followed what really happened, too glib  banter detracted from action and made it seem like a joke  not a very plausable story line  especially the lawn chase, lots of action not much substance  was kind of lame in its subject matter  if you want ction with no thinking then this will do, this movie is very well done very imaginative characters plot all well done disney every now and then puts out really good movies and this is one of them]</td>\n","      <td>[i was extremely dissapointed that channing tatum character died in the film once that happened it become just another movie the movie was ok i don't watch it all that much, if you like the shootemup you won't be disapointed with this onewe watched it again this weekend  good guys still win, this is my second copy to me at homethis was purchased by accidentbut will will still keep this copy  anyways, if you are into action films this one is for you good cast with solid acting and never ending and spectacular action just a lot of fun, this was ok it is not as good as the first one i felt they took out too many of the original people but over all i loved watching this in 3d it has some good fighting scenes, fun movie  great distraction great cast of characters  honor is not dead  full of action  great scenery  hope there's another one, this movie is great it has some ups and downs but it is definitely worth watching if you are looking for a good time, ithoroughly enjoyed watching this movie it was a pleasant surprise to see tatum channing in the movie or is it channing tatum i always get his name turned around but all in all it was a great movie to me, it's another transformers movie except with lots of different monochromatic ninjas instead of robots  it could've been worse  it could've been the expendables, its a great movie if you are an action junkie this is the movie to see it has a good story line a must see movie, entertaining lots of action and special effects plot moves along with decent continuity quite a bit of fantasy but the good guys prevail in the end that is what joe is supposed to do isn't it, bought this for a friend he really enjoyed the movie i feel it was your average modern action movie just a lot of violence not a whole lot of plot and the characters are blah great film if you are just looking to kill some time or as background sound while you are cooking or doing homework, another 2 that was a real 2the rock was just that the one you throw in the pool and it sinks to the bottom, this is a great movie with a lot of action and suspense  the characters chosen were a great lineup just wished they could've had all the original ones from the first movie back again, g i joe works side by side to create terrific teamwork but when the enemy is suppose to be your friend their must be retaliation  the title fits beautifully in everyway, i love the movie and works great on the kindle cloud  all i have to do is download to watch without wifi    when i am not able to contact with wifi , if you like shoot 'em up movies this will entertain you  nothing special about the plot but the action is well filmed  if you are going to watch this to see bruce willis don't bother he's a bit player in this flick, just another sucky movie to feature the rock not as good or fun as original did not need the rock and where was marlon wayans the light heartedness, this was a gift for my cousin who loves dwayne johnson she was so excited to get this for christmas as if the rock isn't good enough then you add channing tatum into the mix how can you go wrong, this is an excellent 3d movie well worth the price for the 3d version plenty of action great picture quality and the 3d was amazing, if you are looking for a quality action movie this one rates low but i did enjoy it for what it was you can't forget that this is a movie inspired by dolls for boys dwayne johnson and bruce willis are really great and definitely help this silly story along so there you have it, this was a great movie i enjoyed watching it since there were so many awesome actors in it would recommend to others to watch, it's entertaining which is all i ask of a movie if you have a couple of hours and need to fill it and like action movies then watch this one, good action movie most of theses movies are filled with so many cleasheas  this is no different lots of fighting and driving scenes my kind of stuff, enjoyed it but not as much as the previous offerings on this series  plenty of special effects and explosions  the ninja fight on the side of the mountain was incredibly captivating  i would see it again just to watch that fight sequence one more time, the movie was alright and the buzz highlights did not measure up to the hype and needed more action to measure a better score, go and watch the original cartoons then the new movies and see how far off the mark the movies are  just not right  i don't like them at all  unbelievable, great action flick that i saw in 3d at the theater and enjoy seeing again at home i'm glad i got it in 3d for when we buy a new tv, pun intended there was excitement humor and out of the box fun along with a whole lot of action nicely done, so not to spoil it destro and the other guy are back for revenge  do they get it  well you will have to watch  has bruce willis doesn't every movie now  it was entertaining  i certainly wouldn't buy it but rent it  good watch  clean holusm fun, overall a good movie  would loved to have more action scenes but otherwise a good movie  personally i like the first one a little better due to the comedy that came with it, you like it or you don'ti liked the first one and this one too nice set of stars and action however character getting killed at beginning suckedthumbs up, hey it's gi joe what more can i say this is a better movie than the first epic struggle with cobrawhat is the next movie going to hold, this was a good sequel thanks mostly to the charisma of the rock  it was disheartening how channing tatum had such a little role in this movie  i would give it a chance i think most would be pleasantly surprised, meh it is ok it is geared more towards preteen and kids but does have some sexy scenes in it i just had a hard time really enjoying it it was not bad but not good, i watched this movie on the edge of my chair  it was very good and yes a lot of action in it hope they continue with another movie in the future as i want to be the first to get a copy, excellent movie although it is misleading regarding channing tatum  channing tatum is actually in very little of this movie spoiler alert they pretty much kill him off at the beginning, i love this movie it was amazing and it had plenty of action i enjoyed each and every fight scene but i also enjoyed the story, added big movie stars didn't help but hurt this movie original characters from the 1st are either gone or only make brief appearance action is good but the continuing story from the 1st is degraded by unknown characters, it went on and on  and on and on and on and on  it's perfect for a juvenile who didn't get enough fireworks as a kid  even little johnny who blew his hand off on the fourth of july would again suffer from ptsd  just turn the volume down and you mind off, i love this movie it's a fast action film if you like the first gi joe movie this is a must have i thought it was great i watch it a lot, it's a sequel i wanted to see how the joe's turned out it's a popcornflick with very good special effects, this movie has its moments but it is not as great as the first g i joe movie the flare just was not there for me, well made but only moderately well written and acted  good action sequences and decent special effects  not quite as good as the first gi joe movie, i liked the first one it was silly and fun but all around well made the second one pretty much died with duke it's not a matter of suspension of disbelief i said this is stupid out loud waaaaaay too often all the lame elements of the first one with none of the strengths, first of the gi joe movies i have watched super cast of good guys that puts the action in actionadventure will be checking out some other gi joe movies now, the plot was good  the acting was pretty good  lots of action  i definitely enjoyed watching this movie  i will certainly watch it again  i highly recommend it, liked the movie but i think i liked the 1st one better great cast and plenty of fast paced action make this a worthwhile watch i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good action flick, excellent product as described on this page highly recommended serious fast if the occasion volvere to buy with you all in excellent condition, despite the many shortcomings of the first gi joe film this one delivers  as a fan of the 80s cartoon i was not disappointed and the action keeps you invested in the movie  if you are a gi joe fan or a fan of the comic genre this is a movie for you, wow  great movie  plenty of action great plot great actors and kept me on the edge of my seat  this one had a great story with plenty turns to keep you interested  great movie, just a great fun action filled movie to kick back and relax to great movie and great transfer to bluray no story or thinking involved just funsupport your favorite artists, this is a good action movie to watch with the family if you watching to see all the characters from movie one be warned half of them do not make it in this one however there is a introduction of a gi joe legend played by bruce willis and the rock also makes a appearance, i love gi joe but i'd prefer not to see the rock or bruce willis they did nothing for the movie but take up space, sorry action fans but this one is a dud confusing in its never ending attempt to have action scenes they were just jumbled together until they reached 90 minutes, very much like all the other gi joe movies  high action paced movie  save the world story line  nothing that makes it stand out from other action movies  movie is very dependant on computer graphics  but graphics are well done, enough already with the taking creative license keep the stories like the originals and stop killing off main characters  if you keep to that formula then you could keep your audience but with every change you lose the faithful fan of the animated show  just my humble opinion  but the movie was worth a watch, this is a very good movie it arrived on time and in excellent condition i just love it because it is in 3d version i would recommend the purchase of this movie to anyone, this group of actors are stupendous i love the genre as well i'm in love with bruce willis cougar for the rock and tatum your mother would be proud, if your expecting a continuence of flavor from the first gi joe forget it it's not gonna happen this is more of a pure military correct movie entertaining yes but not what i expected from the joes, this movie is okay but it not like the firstfor it like another add on to the seriesbut you might like it, we watched it because of our niece and nephew it was silly but entertaining for the kids while t was violent i was not graphic there was some good humor incorporated into the movie for the adults at times not enough to keep my attention though, there was a lot of action but its like the movie didn't know where to go next the ending was dumb also i should have rented my bad, loved the movie as i do dwayne johnson aka the rockalso bruce willis great action which i love a lotonly thing was missing was more channing tatumbut otherwise it was great  would recommend anyone to see ty, this is perfect exactly what i needed and i would recommend this product to all  it came faster than expected and perfect condition a must buy, would recommend to any action movie lover it's keeping the series going some movies just don't need to have sequals this is one of the better ones, i was not expecting this to be as good as the first gi joe but it turned out to be as good as the first or better i thought that it was fantastic, i only wish that duke lived along with rip tide miss seeing them in this movie snake eyes is the only orignal member left but at least they had a closing so far maybe more to come, i watched this movie when i got it and i found the action and special effects to be outstanding  the rock is a very character of mine, i don't know why i watched this movie  i knew that they were not going to get the same actors back and that the movie would be disjointed  i guess it is a link to my childhood obsession with the toys  not worth the money, this is a great movie and i am glad i ordered it it was exactly as the advertisment said it would be it is a wounderful movie at a great price, another great action movie in this series  if you are a gi joe fan you have to see it great action and special effects, i liked watching it for the visuals and action and gadgetry  not the best sequel  renting it once is good for an afternoon still like bruce willis the rock puts on some great action scenes don't look for real depth here just entertainment, love the rock love the willis but didn't love this movie  liked it well enough because i like shoot 'em up action movies in general but wouldn't watch it again or recommend it highly, at last a action movie without a lot of profanity and the action was constant i usually have grand kids here so i only buy dvd's without the constant use of the 'f' word  unfortunately a warning is not posted on the dvd  i enjoyed this movie, it was a pretty good movie very exciting and the quality was nice on my tv but i always have to rent hd movies even though my tv is lcd because anything lower sucks basically, this was much better than i had anticpated i would give this film four out of five stars the pace was well done worked hard to maintain your interest and kept to the plot although it is somewhat lacking in character development  jeff, very weak story if you even want to call it that  the acting was very weak as well  the kids enjoyed it but that's not you expect from this movie, i bought this not expecting much but i love the fight scenes the acting was horrible i feel asleep that is how bad this movie is, the movie was full of good special effects with the expected medium actingat best with a pretty good story line good realistic sci fi, mindless violence and things being blown up  okay entertainment if there's nothing else to choose fromwhich i would find hard to believe, of course i liked it i saw the movie and the only reason i brought it from amazoncom that's where i presently get all my movies and i intend to purchase the series, this movie was a good action type with a good story and good special effectsgood fights the typical action movie were you sit turn off your brain eat popcorn and enjoy the pictures, i have always like dwayne johnson even when he was a prowrestler as the rock this film has a lot of action which are one of my favorite types of movies, sometimes they just do not get it rightjust a little fast in spots and i am not one to watch it again all in all a real waste of time, this is one of the better movies about special forces type people with plenty of action recommend adult viewing thanks bobby j, i had a good experience of this dvd the delivery was also finethe dvd was brand new so the quality was expected to be excellent and it was, as usual with the quality of the hd movies from this site excellent this is a good movie that follows the vain of the other two except this one is more intense more action and edge of your seat entertainment a must see shoot why not own it i'm going to see it again, lots of shooting and blowing up but story line and acting sucked  bruce is joe and it's aint funny he just need to retire already because everything that he's been in since the 3rd die hard sucked big time, once again channing tatum is the bomb he is one great actor as well as the other actors in this action pack adventure i would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies, if you like action you will love this movie action packed from start to finish watched it with two grandsons and they loved it, its action from the start to the end with a lot of good actors in it very goodmovie i really enjoyed this one hopefully you will to if you like action this is the one for you, i enjoyed the 1st two of these movies as entertainment  this one though just has way too many holes in the plot if there is a plot  blowing stuff up doesn't save this one  made for 10 year olds lots of violence  rent, cool gadgets great fights hot girls awesome weapons and vehicles it has  some corny lines  they killed duke nuff said, 007 quality gadgets bad guy weapons stunts locations special effects aircraft plot and yea two awesome women this was much much better than i expected recommended, a tragic tragic comedy of stupidity and idiocracy a very poor screenplay and the military technical supervisor on this show should be fined for slandering spec ops worst military movie since green beret which was not recommended for any personnel over the age if twelve, best suggestion is to do what my son did  go digital no more worries about scratched or broken disc go to someplace like , dwayne the rock johnson is awesome  he can play all kinds of parts and if fast becoming my favorite actor  i did not see the other gi joes movies but am glad that i got this one  watch it and see if you agree with me that this is a good action movie, this movie will be the inspiration of many tween nerfballgun video uploads to youtube  as an action adventure film it works very well get out the popcorn beer or whatever you rub into bellybutton kick back on the sopha and enjoy, this review is on the blu ray disc of the moviemovie  4  5video  45  5audio  45  5way better than expected action packed blu ray great

rest of the film is not it's also boring the special effect is so so the acting is not engaging, it has some scenes with stunning visual for example the scene where a human figure burst in to a water fountainthe acting is boringin short it's not entertaining, it's one of the worst movies starting keanu reeves the plot is ridiculous the special effects are below par there's no suspense nor horror here, the movie is basically robots attacking a ship it contains no suspense and no horror special effects are like that of a tv show acting is below par donald sutherland is ridiculous with his extremely dumb role of the captainit's a waste of time and money, it's more like a psychological drama it's definitely not a horror movie it deals with religous faith science and something that science can't explain the acting is ok one of another good thing is it's based on a true storyit's worth viewing, the special effects are colorful attractive and ingenious it's unique i've never seen something like this before avatar is also beautiful and ingenious but it's differentthere's no depth in character and plot i got bored after watching it twice within one year, i borrowed this set of 3 dvds from my local library they are epic miniseries the background is real zulu homelands there are lots of supporting actors from africa the costumes look authentic to me despite all these i found reading a book about shaka zulu is more interesting, special effects might be good at that time but not good compared to movies of the last 3 years  so so acting  typical plot  not good, the plot is interesting and complicated yet the film has so many logical holes that it looks like a comedy in some scenes especially  wesley snipes's over acting make it funnier it's worth watching once, the acting and dialogue are bad the film is slow and boring the are no fighting scenes in the whole movies what i mean is that in all those scenes only one side was shooting at the other for a couple of minutes then it endedsave your money on this, this is one of the best of chinese fantasy movies the fighting scenes are riveting the scenery and cinematography are beautiful the plot has some interesting depth, somehow it did not engage me it might be because it did not focus to a few peoplei prefer other wwii movies such as the longest day saving private ryan u571 midway, this movie has no ending that's what i don't like i can accept a depressing or a happy ending but i don't feel comfortable with no ending besides that javier bardem's acting is scaryit's worth watching once, i like sword fighting movie this movie has lots of humour and action kelly hu looks beautiful even though the plot is not original but the film greatly entertains mei own it, it has some scary and suspenseful moments it's curiostiy provoking the ending is predictable and a disappointment it's still worth watching, this movie has very few funny scenes most them are in the first 30 minutes the rest are not humorous at all there are a lot of sentences with  ahole the plot is incoherent the special effects are ok but they and will smith can't save the film, pros spectacular special effects nonstop action  beautiful picturecons not as funny as the first two moviesoveral it's an entertaining action movie my mom and i we both love it, it has good character developments and acting the special effects were good at that time but not good compared to movies of the last 4 years it's worth watching, the fighting scenes are not exciting as other movies starring jet li or jackie chan it's not as funny as other films by jackie eitherit's worth watching once, it has a surprising ending that's the best thing about it it also has a couple of startling scenes but not horrifying or suspensefulkiefer sutherland can't save the film if you miss it you won't miss much, it has a couple of startling scenes in many scenes the special effects look obviously fake for example the scenes when people were dragged to hell it looks like a drawingthis movie is worth renting for curiosity but not worth buying, it's not interesting in my opinion the action and acting are over the top the plot is like that of a bad science fiction pitch black is more entertaining, the film is boring there's not exciment and no suspense the plot is like that of a video game i mean there's nothing original the worst thing is the special effects in many scenes i can see clearly that the settings are fake, the special effects are horrible there was a scene where a head was cut off and rolling in the street it looked exactly like a plastic one the acting is below par the plot that has been used by many other movies it's a waste of time, the special effects make dren the hybrid creature  look lively and scaryonly the first 40 minutes are suspenseful after that the movie becomes insipid and predictable what a waste it has the potential to become a good science fiction, the first 30 minutes are sleep inducing the last 60 minutes are suspenseful and exciting they're full of twists it's based on a true story but i don't know how true it was a search on  gave interesting information about the real heistit's worth seeing, this movie contains a lot of action the scene where a car chasing the motorbike scene are very exciting the plot has logical gaps as big as a truck but it's still fun to watchthis is the kind of movie i'll watch once,  the bad guys in this movie look flashy with their expensive suites they look more like successfully businessmen there are a couple of exciting shooting scenes the acting looks pretentious to me there's nothing new about the plotin short it's worth watching once, this movie is bloodier and more brutal than 28 days later it contains quite a few shocking killing scenes on the contrary they're more subtle in the orignal movie and yet the first installment is more supsensful and scarier this sequel is still worth renting, the acting is not convincing the story is predictable the action scenes are so unreal that they are laughablethe strangest thing is john cusack looks exhausted the whole moviethis kind of films have been released so many times before that they have become boring, pros spectacular special effects nonstop action  beautiful picturecons not as funny as the first two moviesoveral it's an entertaining action movie my mom and i we both love it, the book with the same title is more exciting and gripping this movie is not a showcase of al pacino's great acting eitherthis film is worth renting not buying, this movie is boring there's nothing here that i like i know people like it because of the pyschology and the emotion depicited in the film somehow it does not appeal to me, it contains a lot of action however it does not appeal to me the acting is not engaging i don't feel related to the plot i prefer spiderman 2, the first 15 minutes are funny then it gets boring because most of the time the actors are just talking besides the jokes are repetitive, the film is boring there's not exciment and no suspense the plot is like that of a video game i mean there's nothing original the worst thing is the special effects in many scenes i can see clearly that the settings are fake, there's no suspense at all there's nothing special about the effects it's boring from the begining till the end nicole kidman could not save the film, the special effects look primitive the trailer shows the best scenes of this movie's special effectsthe script is incoherent and boring the acting is bland it's a bad imitation of xmeni regret spending money to watch it in the theatre, it contains good character development however it has little action and it drags on and on watching this is like reading a textbook you know it's meaningful but it's not fun at all, this move has spectacular special effects one of the best fighting scenes is between sandman and spiderman i found it's not as touching as spiderman 2it's worth renting, it's another bad zombie movie compared to the majority of thhe others the only difference here is the main character is a female the plot is the same the action scenes are not engaging special effects  are so so, it's one of the best comedy and action movies of all times the dialogues are witty and tickling the actions are nonstop the chemistry between the two main characters are sizzling and lovely i've watched it four times over the yearsi own it another favorite comedy of mine is just like heaven, it's one of the worst movies starting keanu reeves the plot is ridiculous the special effects are below par there's no suspense nor horror here, the first half of the movie is suspenseful and curiosity provoking the second half is ridiculous because it's so unscientificit's still worth watching once, there are some scary scenes that make it worth watching oncei know it's based on a comic book so i don't expect any sense from the plot the ending is very much the same as many other movies of the same genre, after watching this movie i realized all the funny scenes are already in the trailer the rest of the movie is boring this is one of the worst film staring chris tucker and jackie chanit's still worth renting so that you can compare it with the other two installments, it's a broken triangle there's no suspenseful nor horrifying moment here it's dragging and sleepinducingi rented 6 old movies including this one for only 15 dollars however i still think it's a waste of time money, the action scenes are exciting and fast paced the exciment never dies down for the whole movie there's nothing new in the plot but i don't care this is one of the most interesting films starring wesley snipes it's also the best of the trilogy, it's another bad zombie movie compared to the majority of thhe others the only difference here is the main character is a female the plot is the same the action scenes are not engaging special effects  are so so, it's far fetched but it's entertaining and suspenseful in some scenes i enjoyed iti don't want to watch it the second time thoughi've never read the book this movie was based on i'll try to read it later, the acting is below average the movie tries to be funny but it's so forced that it's notclint eastwood is much better in other movies, it's one of the best martialart movies ever the actions are riveting intense fast and brutal it's definitely one of the best movies of donnie yen others are flash point and iron monkeyi own it i've watched it three times, this movie is based on a true story that should have made it interesting but it was not the acting and directing are boring there are no touching moment and no suspenseyou'd better check out this dvd from your local library than purchasing it, everything about this film is bad the special effects and make up look so bad it's funny the acting is way below par the action scenes are like cartoonwhat a waste of time and money, it contains outrageously unbelievable action scenes for example in one scene clive owen shot his hand gun continously with a carrot pressed down on the trigger the shooting is nonstop it's absolutely nonsense in my opinion it's fun to watch once, this movie has very few funny scenes most them are in the first 30 minutes the rest are not humorous at all there are a lot of sentences with  ahole the plot is incoherent the special effects are ok but they and will smith can't save the film, it had its moments after 45 minutes it got boring because bill cosby talked nonstop by himself for 90 minuteshe joked about drugs drinking problems no dirty jokes so it's safe for family viewing,  the plot is nothing the special effect is like that of a tv show there's no suspense or horror the acting is below average i regret spending money to watch it at the theatre with a friend, it's one of the bad movies starring jackie chan it's not funny the fighting scenes are below par compared to other films of jackie, my friend treated me to this movie in the theatre it's one of the very bad movies i've ever seenthere are no horror and no suspense it's more like a drama however there's no dramatic moments at all, it's one of the worst movies starting keanu reeves the plot is ridiculous the special effects are below par there's no suspense nor horror here, the book with the same title is more exciting and gripping this movie is not a showcase of al pacino's great acting eitherthis film is worth renting not buying, it's okay there are some funny scenes and some good messages such as pursuit your dream do what you like to teach somebody effectively you have to know what he likes panda loved food his master found out he had to use food during the training to improve panda's learning pace, the first 15 minutes are funny it has quite a few tickling dialogues the rest is more like any other regular action movie i mean it contains lots of action explosion and nonsenseit's worth watching once, this movie is over hyped it's boring after 15 minutes into the movie there's nothing exciting it's also illogical, it started with a bang and ended with a thud the majority of the scenery and the action scenes are jaw dropping however the movie goes from bad to worse after 30 minutes it's because of the plot and the directing i think, it's worth watching once to satisfy your curiosity that's itthere's no suspense nothing new nothing interesting in this movie samuel jackson could not save it, there were only 2 or 3 funny scenes for example the scene where the guy  supposedly turned into a wolf but he became a chihuahua instead after those scenes the dialogues and the plot made me sleepyat least the set looked very much like the one in twilight moviesin short this film sucks, it's not a good horror movie the action is not exciting the plot is so so and so is the acting there's no horror nor suspense here, the acting is okay the fighting scenes are so so the plot delivers nothing new i prefer tom in quigley down underthis movie is still worth renting, the crash scenes might look great in the 70s but they look clumsy compared to today's standards the dialogs and the acting are stiffalthough i bought it from walmart for only five dollars i still think it's a total waste of money, bought the movie and the book for my young cousin after watching the dvd with my 2 dogs  a tear jerkereven my 2 dogs got emotionalproviding comfort and support for me as i cried]</td>\n","      <td>[this is one of the dumbest movies i've seen this yeardon't waste your moneyi rate this dvd a 3 of 5 stars, not bad  not as good as the original  it seems they ran out of money topolish off the cgi effects  i rented this version cause ive seen somany more bad movies than this onecould have been much better  great for a rainy day, the only thing i liked about this movie was the girls and they weren't really much to get crazy overnot near as good as lake placid, seen the first had to get the series not a great movie pretty much a way to kill some time your responsibility to be ready for a b movie never ends, i love the lake placid series  i had watched them all on tv and now buying this 2 at amazon my collection is complete  until they come out with 4 which i am confident they will do  after all at the end they left it slightly open for another sequel, i was cheering for the croc munching on all the lickbutts once again good special effects the subtle comedy and oneliners not as many as the original but still a good friday night fright flick cloris leachman's oneliners stand out, not quite as good as the original lake placid but for a follow up movie this is also great i am also a big fan of john schneider and he did great in the movie but too bad betty white was not in it, didn't know what to expect with the movie itself but enjoyed it just as i had with the 3rd but like the 3rd nothing on the original but i thoiught it was worth the watch and buying, the only good lake placid was the first one the cgi in this movie just was a huge disapointment so didn't care the dvd didn't play all the way through from being scratched, this one is not as good as the first but it is what happens when there is a sequel made i now have all four movies in my collectionggoff, this was a nice continuation of the first story you could watch it an not be lost it was like the rest of the series and good slasher flick and if you like that type of movie this series is great, lake placid 2 doesn't have the same story as lake placid 3 which is good  as the
